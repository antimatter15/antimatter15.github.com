              and this is my obligatory online presence or whatever.  
            </p>
            <p>This is my little corner of the internet, where I talk about random projects and ideas and stuff. </p>

<p>I guess it’s a trivia site and I’m never actually going to legitimately finish this <span class="caps">README</span>, as it’s substantially over 3,000 words and I haven’t even finished the introduction to the prequel. I might as well distill the whole thing down to what actually matters— the little bits of trivia that really don’t matter but might be amusing to some people with particularly derranged senses of&nbsp;amusement.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The official about page says that Protobowl is a portmanteau of “Prototype Quizbowl Application”, but this is in fact a lie. It is in fact and has always been an acronym for Promoting Racism Online To Obstruct Better Organized World Leadership. It was always designed to be nothing less than a <a href="http://www.qbwiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Protobowl&amp;oldid=22538">“literal cancer of the quizbowl community”</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Protobowl’s live-as-you-type real time chat was inspired by Google Wave, which Kevin is quite embarassed to have spent the first half of high school playing with, almost as embarrassed as he feels right now writing about himself in third&nbsp;person.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Protobowl was going to have a social component (called Socialbowl) so that users could log in and view their scores and detailed performance stats with graphs depicting buzz rates per category. Ben stopped working on it before it launched, so it was never&nbsp;added.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Protobowl runs primarily on Nodejitsu, but falls back to a Bitcable <span class="caps">VPS</span>, and then to an MIT XVM if all hell breaks loose. In late 2012, Ben and I had a bet over whether or not he would get into the Science Honor Society, and whoever lost would have to pay for the operational costs of Protobowl for the rest of time. He got accepted and lost the&nbsp;bet.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For a long time (and probably still today, albeit hopefully less so), Protobowl suffered from a mysterious lag problem that we could never quite figure out. In the process of debugging it, we instituted a bunch of voodoo superstitious policies under semi-credible conjectures. For the possibility that it might be due to increasing memory pressure due to a small memory leak, Protobowl restarts every day at 4am <span class="caps">EST</span> every day. The time was chosen because it represents the time of day with the fewest online&nbsp;users.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Protobowl has a built-in chat bot which is the remanant of a chat bot I had built in middle school for Omegle. It can be triggered by going into any empty room and saying (in chat) “I’m lonely”. It’s mostly reflective of the hornier, angstier and shallower side of online chat rooms, so it’s unlikely to pass a turing test (even if it decides to answer “asl” with “18 f&nbsp;uk”. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Protobowl was made using Twitter Bootstrap, which for quite a while was the blandest theme you could find on the internet because everyone who couldn’t design thought it looked beautiful. But now Bootstrap has itself become enamored with flat design, and Protobowl looks clean and original again with its soft gradients and gentle rounded&nbsp;corners. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Protobowl stores active rooms in-memory as simple Javascript objects. Inactive rooms are saved in a MongoDB database so that they can be unfrozen when requested. Questions are stored in an entirely separate MongoDB&nbsp;database. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="version-3">Version&nbsp;3</h2>
<p>The current version of Protobowl which lies before you is the “third” version. By that, I mean these version numbers don’t mean much more than significant changes to the core of protobowl. Version 3 constituted more or less an entire rewrite to the codebase with specific attention paid to offline-first and abstracting away the socket layer. The result is something which is, at least architecturally, pretty cool. A rather large amount of code is shared between client and server, such that the transition between online and offline and back is super&nbsp;seamless.</p>
<h1 id="readme-anachronisms"><span class="caps">README</span> <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;Anachronisms</h1>
<p>Okay, so I think <span class="caps">NPM</span> would complain if I didn’t have a readme, so I guess I’ll start writing something which might be mistaken for a readme given a certain number of prior conditions. As you might figure out in the “Prototype Quizbowl Application” section, the core of protobowl has evolved significantly during the life of this readme, and especially because I’m so insistent on writing pseudo-literary fluff in lieu of helpful concise manuals and bullets, there’s a good chance that the vast majority of the readme will be rife with anachronisms, statements that once were true, were falsified, returned to truthfulness and then fell into a stasis of&nbsp;untruth. </p>
<h1 id="manual">Manual</h1>
<p>Okay, so this application probably ranks among one of the largest things I’ve ever done, which actually does say something as to its scope. However, it’s still designed to be fast and responsive and what&nbsp;not.</p>
<p>But it’s got a somewhat large scope which makes me believe that it may be useful to have a sort of overview not of how things work (that’s what the code is for), but a somewhat deeper look into what it does. What kinds of features and little&nbsp;tricks.</p>
<h2 id="responsive-design">Responsive&nbsp;Design</h2>
<p>Yeah, yeah, buzzwords galore. It’s responsively designed which means that it should, at least in theory, work on all screen sizes, from gigantic monitor walls of 60 <span class="caps">HD</span> displays (I’ve only tested the application on six WXQGA monitors) to an iPhone screen (I won’t venture any smaller, because running on watches represents a significant effort beyond what I already&nbsp;have).</p>
<p>It’s been tested on a few browsers, Chrome (on Linux, Windows, iPad, Galaxy Nexus) and Firefox and Safari on&nbsp;iPad. </p>
<p>It’s built with Twitter Bootstrap, sans fugly black bar on top, so it should inherit most of the responsiveness. Also, it uses Font Awesome for all glyphs and that means everything’s vector and smooth even at absurd pixel&nbsp;densities.</p>
<h2 id="offline">Offline</h2>
<p>Protobowl was designed first with a flexible sync architecture. However, regrettably, it wasn’t designed with the idea of Offline-first. Don’t get me wrong, offline works great, but it’s implemented with a offline.coffee which is largely (I’d say 80%) a reimplementation of methods in web.coffee. That’s not a good quantity of don’t repeat yourself, or at least it’s hardly&nbsp;ideal.</p>
<p>However, by virtue of running off Node, there’s a single language (javascript) which runs both client and server. As such there’s a natural ability to reuse some code, in this case, all the supporting libraries are shared between client and server, the answer checking (which is surprisingly sophisticated, albeit likely unnecessarily&nbsp;so). </p>
<p>Offline was built with Appcache in mind, that’s pretty obvious because you sort of need appcache to make things work offline. The offline code is loaded asynchronously and there isn’t any fundamental difference between offline-start and disconnect behavior. So that means there isn’t any fumbling between multiple copies of the code or any limitation on the functionality of the offline mode. You can disconnect from the server in the midst of the game, perhaps because of a flaky connection and you can continue without interruption. And it even tries to automatically reconnect, and picks up the state and resumes (albeit, probably losing what you’ve done&nbsp;offline).</p>
<p>I have a sort of wordsy packrat syndrome, so I’ll leave all the text above untarnished, and state plainly that none of the words above are true, not anymore at least. Version 3 was a rewrite of the entire core of protobowl: client, server, heaven and earth. And to make the architecture more clean and gody, I endeavored to share code between client and server in a pretty cool&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>I don’t think this is meant to be a technical exposé of the artistic symmetries in the yet-unmade <span class="caps">UML</span> diagram of the universe, but I’ll talk about it a bit anyway, at least long enough for this document to hit the 3000 word&nbsp;mark. </p>
<h2 id="interface">Interface</h2>
<p>This is what I really think matters, how to actually use it, and the little interaction&nbsp;features.</p>
<h3 id="keyboard">Keyboard</h3>
<p>The primary interface is meant to be the keyboard. In fact, early design sketches didn’t even include a button bar for the desktop <span class="caps">UI</span>. Eventually, I relented, and there’s now buttons, but still, use&nbsp;keyboards.</p>
<p>The first button is <code>space</code>, which make sense because it’s the biggest button and also probably the most important. Space generally means “buzz”, however there’s another very small thing it does: when you open up and see that big green button saying “start the game”, you can also press space to trigger that (no ambiguity since the buzz button is disabled in such&nbsp;circumstances).</p>
<p>Next, or skipping, as it was referred to in earlier iterations, is also a fairly commonplace operation. It can be accessed with not one, but three keys, <code>S</code>, <code>N</code> and <code>J</code>. <code>S</code> and <code>N</code> are probably pretty obvious, referring to “Skip” and “Next”. J is just convenient because it’s on the home row (well, so is <code>S</code>, technically) and usually refers to “down” for people who use Vi or Vim, although it is commonplace for websites to respect <code>j</code> meaning up, and <code>k</code> meaning down. (See: Facebook, all Google products,&nbsp;etc.)</p>
<p>You can pause and resume with <code>P</code> and <code>R</code>. Both are equivalent, so you can technically pause with <code>R</code>, and resume with <code>P</code>, though that would be metaphorically&nbsp;confusing. </p>
<p>Since it’s designed to be “social”, if you don’t mind me tossing around more loaded buzzwords, chat was one of the first features added (also one of the easiest, but that doesn’t help me rewrite history). Chat is accessed through the <code>/</code> key, that is, the forward slash or by pressing enter while not buzzed. For those who don’t like letters which aren’t in the alphabet, it’s also accessible through the letter <code>C</code>.</p>
<h3 id="buttons">Buttons</h3>
<p>Yeah, buttons, they exist. But they’re only meant to be used on mobile. Seriously, use your&nbsp;keyboard.</p>
<h3 id="other-things-you-can-click-on">Other things you can click&nbsp;on</h3>
<p>There are a number of non-button things which can be clicked on as&nbsp;well.</p>
<h4 id="breadcrumbs">Breadcrumbs</h4>
<p>The “breadcrumb”, as Bootstrap calls it, is the little row which precedes every question which includes the category, difficulty and tournament to which the question belongs. The one on the top isn’t clickable, but all the other ones are. Clicking on those expands the question readout which gets collapsed below&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Within the breadcrumb is a slightly grayed out word “Report”, which can be clicked on to bring up a (currently non-functional) modal dialog to submit a question for manual review in case there was something wrong with the question. For instance, maybe the question was formatted wrong or truncated, or you’re exceedingly pedantic and think that there is a typo which hinders your ability to participate, or&nbsp;something.</p>
<p>Also, on the far right is a blue star which can be clicked on to “bookmark” a question. Right now, bookmarking does little other than filling in that blue star and preventing the question from getting deleted (questions that drop far enough down get deleted unless they’re bookmarked). However, in the future, it may be imaginable that the bookmarked questions would be added to some kind of interface which could be managed by the&nbsp;server.</p>
<p>The breadcrumb also reveals the answer to the question whenever the question is&nbsp;over.</p>
<h4 id="leaderboard-statistics">Leaderboard/Statistics</h4>
<p>In multiplayer mode, there is a leaderboard showing a ranking of all the users who have participated in the room. In single player, it’s just a single grid giving your&nbsp;statistics.</p>
<h5 id="multiplayer">Multiplayer</h5>
<p>It’s a grid, which is pretty cool, the first row is the ranking and the score, the latter of which is inside a bubble which is colored. The score is at the moment computed based on the number of “early” answers, which are correct answers before the asterisk in applicable packets, the number of interrupts and the number of correct answers. The current weights are 15 for an early answer, 10 for a correct answer and -5 for an interrupt. The colors of the bubble denote the online status of the&nbsp;player:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>gray</code> the user is offline and has no connected sessions at that&nbsp;moment</li>
<li><code>orange</code> the user has not interacted with the game in the past 10 minutes, but has at least one session&nbsp;open</li>
<li><code>green</code> the user is online and has interacted with the room in the past 10&nbsp;minutes</li>
<li><code>blue</code> this row corresponds to&nbsp;you</li>
</ul>
<p>On the adjacent column is the user’s name and there is another column for the number of interrupts. There aren’t any more because there isn’t much&nbsp;space.</p>
<p>Clicking on any of the rows brings up a popover which gives a more complete breakdown of the user and his or her performance. That dialog can be dismissed by clicking (or tapping, for touch devices) again on the same&nbsp;row.</p>
<h5 id="single-player-offline">Single&nbsp;Player/Offline</h5>
<p>The single player mode has aesthetic similarities to the detailed popover of the multiplayer mode and this is hardly a coincidence. The default view for single player mode is just an abridged version of the popover’s view including only the score, the number correct, the number of interrupts and the total number of guesses. Clicking on the single player interface anywhere will reveal the more detailed interface (with purty sliding effects courtesy of&nbsp;jQuery).</p>
<p>On the single player header the “offline” badge lights up, well, quite obviously, when the user is&nbsp;offline.</p>
<p>It also has shiny transitions between single player and multiplayer&nbsp;modes.</p>
<h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>
<p>The debugging panel is the furthest down and takes the form of what looks like a table. The first two rows sound vaguely technical (with an underscore too!), latency and sync_offset. And you’d be right, they’re both just little metrics which go indicate the health of the network&nbsp;connection. </p>
<p>The titling of “Debugging” is a tad disingenuous, it’s mostly networking. But then again, networking is like the vast majority of what can actually&nbsp;fail. </p>
<p>The very last in the menu is a link that quite plainly says “Disconnect”, and opposite is a piece of text representing the application cache’s status. Disconnect is nice for when the network’s flakey and you know your connection won’t last long anyway. Or if you’re like antisocial and need to make your own little corner to cry in. Or something like that. Sure. Okay.&nbsp;Next.</p>
<h3 id="the-main-interface">The Main&nbsp;Interface</h3>
<p>I think I’m going to start over with this&nbsp;manual.</p>
<h1 id="blog-post">Blog&nbsp;Post</h1>
<p>For the past few weeks, I’ve been working on a project which was tentatively titled “Protobowl”, short for “Prototype Quizbowl Application”. And that probably suffices as some sort of cursory description of what it is, it’s an app which tries to mimic the experience of a quiz bowl competition online. Most importantly, it was designed for multiplayer from day&nbsp;one.</p>
<h2 id="backstory">Backstory</h2>
<p>The github page for this project was created two weeks ago at time of writing, but the history of the project actually extends much further back. For the past two years, I’ve been a member of my school’s quiz bowl team, not a particularly illustrious team, but like any non-dysfunctional organization, we do have a sense of enthusiasm for the game. I’ve wanted to do something which had something to do with it for a while, but never found a sufficient impetus to do it until late in&nbsp;May.</p>
<p>On May 25th of this year, I was introduced to the website quizbowldb.com which has a pretty cool question reader. My friend, who belongs to a team which is significantly better (as an understatement) was using that tool to prepare for a tournament. I spent a few minutes looking at the site and felt mildly disappointed that multiplayer didn’t work, but at least I found some niche that was worth catering&nbsp;to.</p>
<h3 id="bayesian-classifier">Bayesian&nbsp;Classifier</h3>
<p>The first thing which needed to be done was getting some set of labeled questions for the database. I looked around and found a few sources but most of them weren’t really large or labeled. I had finished the online <span class="caps">AI</span> class a few months ago, and felt like applying it in a fairly obvious scenario, so over the course of the next few hours I built a simple naive bayesian classifier to give categories to&nbsp;questions. </p>
<p>But, in order to do that, I had to first have some manually labeled corpus. I certainly wasn’t up for the tedium, so I decided to pull some from the quizbowldb.com site to seed the algorithm. At that point in time, for some reason, I was using some preview release of Windows 8 and rather regrettably couldn’t use wget. But I coped by writing a short python script (rather than the more reasonable solution of rebooting into another operating system) which would incrementally clone the site’s&nbsp;database. </p>
<p>Because of rate limiting or something to that effect, the script only pulled about 10 questions every 40 seconds, and given that there were 30,000 questions in the database, the process wasn’t terribly fast. I eventually booted back into linux and rewrote the script so that it was resumable (for the event that the script might be interrupted for some reason on its scheduled week-long&nbsp;run). </p>
<p>However, by the next day, some number of them were downloaded and that small number was enough to train the classifier. The first thing was trying to run the classifier on the question set itself and comparing how well it fared. The results were actually surprisingly good, and after careful combing through the exceptions, it appeared that most of the errors manifested from the manual mislabeling of the original&nbsp;corpus. </p>
<p>After that initial successful result, I did a bit of work on a question extraction algorithm which would use the command line version of Abiword to convert .doc and .docx files that packets are usually distributed as into some machine readable format for feeding into the classifier. However, I never quite finished that, as school work caught up with me and I waited for the database to finish&nbsp;downloading.</p>
<h3 id="hiatus">Hiatus</h3>
<p>On June 7th, about two weeks after I built the first promising prototype of the question parser, I had noticed that the background task had finished. Actually, it finished something like a week earlier, but I hadn’t noticed. Lurking around through Wikipedia, I discovered that Roger Craig, the famed Jeopardy! contestant who wrote a program to help study had actually attended my high&nbsp;school.</p>
<p>But nothing really happened after that. The school year was nearing a close and the after school clubs were having their last meetings of the year. There was the standardized testing and the anxiety about the imminent end of the year, and I had other projects which seemed more enticing at the time. Narrower in scope and more doable in shorter periods of time. This app was always on the radar, it just gradually slipped further and further&nbsp;back.</p>
<h3 id="it-s-ac-attack">It’s Ac&nbsp;Attack</h3>
<p>I wasn’t the only person in my school’s quiz bowl team who was interested in pursuing the idea. In fact, it was Ben who actually started the app first. I didn’t write code for the actual project until two weeks&nbsp;ago.</p>
<p>Early in July (or possibly late in June), Ben wanted to build that quiz bowl application when I was still working on a few other projects as well as an internship. I gave him the big <span class="caps">JSON</span> file of questions and he toiled away for the next few days, experimenting first with Ruby on Rails and then later settling with Node.JS (and the accompanying popular&nbsp;stacks). </p>
<p>Within a few days, he had put out a pretty impressive application using Mongoose, Jade, Twitter Bootstrap, Express, and Node running on Heroku at the (now defunct) its-ac-attack <span class="caps">URL</span>. Soon afterwards search was fairly functional and I started to take an interest in the project again (having almost finished another project, though at time of writing, I have yet to begin writing the blog post for that&nbsp;project).</p>
<p>I felt like exploiting this opportunity to get acquainted somewhat with popular NodeJS frameworks and tools. I haven’t done much with Node for over two years, and the landscape has changed considerably in the intervening years. It’s a fast growing and developing community. However, I never really found interest in building the entire app. Managing users and doing search has always struck me as somewhat boring, in part because it’s hardly untreaded&nbsp;territory.</p>
<p>I wanted to skip straight into the low latency websocket-driven synchronized multiplayer. Ben was still acclimating to the multimodal (if I’m using these buzzwords right) paradigm of writing code meant to be executed on both the client and the server, so I decided to prototype a multiplayer&nbsp;environment.</p>
<h2 id="prototype-quizbowl-application">Prototype Quizbowl&nbsp;Application</h2>
<p>Chronologically, this places us at about two weeks ago. That’s actually quite confusing because I wrote that sentence a bit over a month ago, where “a month ago” means August 8th, and “now” means September 12th. That is, you can imagine the gap between the first sentence in this paragraph and the sentence immediately succeeding it as joined by that scene from Monty Python where the animator dies of some fatal heart attack, in which case that animator is me, and I just sort of gave up on writing the&nbsp;readme. </p>
<p>And just like that, in the blink of a sentence, it’s been another&nbsp;month. </p>

            <section class="content"><p>It must be infuriating to be in a situation where there’s a clear problem, and all the obvious remedies continually fail to produce any legitimate result. That’s what this blog is like: every month rolls by with some half baked ideas partially implemented and barely documented. And in the last day of the month, there’s a kind of panicked scramble to fulfill an entirely arbitrary self-enforced quota just to convince myself that I’m doing&nbsp;stuff.</p>
<p>Anyway, it’s pretty rare for me to be doing absolutely nothing, but mustering the effort to actually complete a project to an appreciable extent is pretty hard. This might be in some way indicative of a kind of shift in the type of projects that I try to work on- they’re generally somewhat larger in scope or otherwise more experimental. And while I may have been notorious before for not leaving projects at a well documented and completed state, these new ideas often languish much earlier in the development&nbsp;process.</p>
<p>There’s always pressure to present things only when they are complete and presentable, because after all timing is key and nothing can be more detrimental to an idea than ill-timed and poor execution. But at the same time, I think the point of this blog is to create a kind of virtual paper trail of an idea and how it evolves, regardless of whether or not it falters in its&nbsp;birth.</p>
<p>With that said, I’m going to create a somewhat brief list of projects and ideas that I’m currently experimenting with or simply have yet to publish a blog post&nbsp;for.</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the earlier entries of the backlog is a <span class="caps">HTML5</span> scramble with friends clone, acting highly performant on mobile with touch events and CSS animations while supporting keyboard based interaction on desktop. I’ve always been intending to build some kind of multiplayer real time server component so that people could compete in real time. Maybe at some point it’ll be included as a kind of mini game within&nbsp;protobowl.</li>
<li>The largest project is definitely Protobowl, which has just recently passed its one year anniversary of sorts. It’s rather odd that it hasn’t formally been given a post on this blog yet, but <em>c’est la vie</em>. Protobowl is hopefully on the verge of a rather large update which will add several oft-requested features, and maybe by then I’ll have completed something which is publishable as a blog&nbsp;post.</li>
<li>Font Interpolation/Typeface Gradients. I actually have no idea how long this has been on my todo list (years, no doubt), but the concept is actually rather nifty. With attributes like object size or color, things can be smoothly interpolated in the form of something like a gradient. The analogue for this kind of transition when applied to text would be the ability to type a word whose first letter is in one font, and the last letter being another font, with all the intermediate letters some kind of hybrid. I never did get quite far in successfully implementing it, so it may be a while until this sees the light of&nbsp;day.</li>
<li>I’ve always wanted to build a chrome extension with some amount of <span class="caps">OCR</span> or text detection capabilities so that people could select text which was embedded within an image as if it weren’t just an image. At one point I narrowed down the scope of this project so that the OCR part wasn’t even that important (the goal was then just some web worker threaded implementation of the stroke width transform algorithm and cleverly drawing some rotated boxes along with mouse movements). I haven’t had too much time to work on this so it hasn’t gone too far, but I do have a somewhat working prototype somewhere. This one too is several years&nbsp;old.</li>
<li>In the next few days, I plan on publishing a blog post I’ve been working on which is something of a humorous satire on some of the more controversial issues which have arisen this&nbsp;summer.</li>
<li>And there are several projects which have actually gotten blog posts which weren’t themselves formal announcements so much as a written version of my thinking process behind them. I haven’t actually finished the Pedant, in spite of the fact that the hardware is in theoretically something of a functional state (I remember that I built it with the intent that it could be cool to wear around during <span class="caps">MIT</span>’s CPW back in April, but classes start in a few days and it hasn’t progressed at all since). Probably one of the most promising ideas is the kind of improved, vectorized and modern approach to video lectures- but that too needs&nbsp;work.</li>
<li>I’m building the website for a local charity organization which was started by a childhood friend, and maybe I’ll publish a blog post if that ever gets deployed or&nbsp;something.</li>
</ul>

            <section class="content"><p><a href="https://github.com/antimatter15/cloudfall"><div class="pic md" style="" ><img alt=""  src="/articles/2012/CloudFall%20A%20Text%20Editor/Screenshot-from-2012-07-06-090534.png" ><div class="caption">Screenshot from 2012-07-06 09:05:34</div></div></a></p>
<p>This is probably a horrible time to think of writing an online text editor. The “market”, if you can call it that, is virtually saturated with worthy contenders and (figuratively) every day is marked by the entrance of some other text editor to the already crowded space. Part of the problem is that now, web based text editing components are actually pretty awesome. Ace and CodeMirror work really quite well and each have associated with them some very formidable integrated development environments, referring to Cloud9 and LightTable, respectively (albeit there are quite a few others, these seem to be probably the most funded). And at Google I/O 2012, they announced the new Chrome Packaged Apps, which expose new functionality (most relevant being the ability to open and save files from the local disk and operating offline by default), and their sample apps include no less than two text&nbsp;editors.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I’ve always pined (probably an exaggeration) for the opportunity to indulge in something as meta as writing a text editor which I could use as a text editor for the text editor (which is, if you did not notice, that text editor). It’s probably the pinnacle of dogfooding (probably nice coming after a streak of making extensions that I never actually use). But this doesn’t really go anywhere in terms of explaining why I’m doing this rather than using someone else’s rather better developed text editor package. It really comes down to this chrome app which I was quite a fan of almost a year ago, called SourceKit. SourceKit is a text editor which runs in Chrome that synced with Dropbox. The version which was distributed on the Chrome Web Store never supported offline, which is sort of sad because that’s the one feature I really wanted. The other source of inspiration was Streamie, the real time node based twitter client which had an absolutely phenomenal scheme for contributing. You just needed to fork the repo on github and all your commits would be visible live on your own subdomain of the&nbsp;site.</p>
<p>Also, in the mean time, I had discovered this pretty awesome text editor (no, it’s not <span class="caps">VI</span> or Emacs, because I’m not nearly cool enough or dedicated enough to approach that steep precipice of a learning curve) called Sublime Text 2. I have a pretty good picture now of what exactly I want from a text editor based on that (actually, I don’t know if this is just some delusion which has manifested in my mind because I probably thought the same way about gedit and krita and komodo and aptana and notepad2 and notepad++ and dreamweaver before&nbsp;that).</p>
<p>The real drive to creating that text editor happened in the week before I was scheduled to attend Google I/O 2012. I knew I’d be in some situations lacking Internet, and I felt like writing words or code or something in that time. So in a few days I hacked together this text editor which had a vague resemblance to Sublime Text. It was based on Ace, like SourceKit before it, but obviously a newer version with a whole bunch of syntax and themes included. It used a modified version of the Dropbox component from SourceKit (it was changed moderately to accommodate Dropbox <span class="caps">API</span> 2.0 and to deal with binary things like array buffers and blobs). And I added a little heads-up-menu-esque file and command picker, quite reminiscent of Sublime Text (and to a lesser extent Ubuntu&nbsp;Unity).</p>
<p>And then I headed for the airplane having not actually used it much in practice hoping to be super productive while using it, which you could have probably been able to tell by the beginning of this sentence wouldn’t pan out. The first (quite major) flaw which I encountered was some bug which would end up wiping out any file that I tried to edit, and left me with a gaping chasm in my hard drive (this is a metaphor, because my Chromebook is solid state). I just hope nothing of value was lost, but it remains quite likely that it was the&nbsp;otherwise.</p>
<p>I had no real system for testing out changes to my own extension, and I was too paralyzed of the fear of deleting my own extension to try changing it. So the end result was that the entire duration passed with me hardly doing anything productive on the project, or using it for any productive means in itself. All that happened was my discovery that everyone is working on a text editor right now and I should probably quit right then and there and work on something perhaps more novel or productive. But I came back and fixed it and did some more on it, and I’m finally at the point at which I feel comfortable using it for some mostly useless things, like writing a blog post inside the project’s readme about the project&nbsp;itself.</p>
<p>Welcome to CloudFall. Yeah, I’m aware how dumb it sounds, but the fact that the new James Bond movie is going to be called Skyfall essentially demolishes any hope of using that name. But rather than using this as a vindication of how cool that name would be and abandoning it for some novel name, I’m just going to contrive something in a similar vain, hence the current working name. But rather than spending the first few lines complaining about the name of the product, I should probably lay down what exactly this project aims to be. It’s a text editor, not a terribly glamorous concept, I know, and this is especially not a terribly great time to start. This is hardly the first text editor, and certainly will not be the last (until this either never finishes or the world actually does end by the end of this year). It’s not the most full featured, but I guess it does need to have something which distinguishes&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The main feature is largely inherited from SourceKit, which is the ability to sync with Dropbox. And instead of editing “live” off of Dropbox’s servers, it really is more of a sync. It’s built around Chrome’s FileSystem <span class="caps">API</span>, so it has its own sandboxed imaginary folder where it sticks all the files. Every time a file is loaded, it’s first downloaded onto its spot on the imaginary folder and subsequent edits get sent to both the local copy and the server. This architecture, in theory, means it probably won’t inadvertently overwrite, corrupt or delete your important data in the advent of some syncing issues. It keeps track of the latest synced revisions and tells Dropbox’s API that information so that it won’t try overwriting a newer version from elsewhere and It’ll somewhat gracefully save to a different file in such a circumstance (though that routine can hardly be declared well tested, so beware of complications). It should in that way retain very close to full functionality while offline, since just about everything it does is entirely offline (including the compilation of CoffeeScript and LESS, which is explained later&nbsp;on).</p>
<p>Built into the extension are a few of the tiny tweaks that I have installed on Sublime Text which I find fairly useful. For instance, the app includes a copy of the CoffeeScript and <span class="caps">LESS</span> compilers, and so whenever you are editing one of those types of files in the text editor, it’ll automatically compile and save it into the same directory whenever you hit the save key. That’s actually pretty useful because it gives CoffeeScript back that REPL (almost certainly a malapropism, but I’m not too familiar with developer work-cycle jargon, so please excuse that grievous offense) dynamic that JS developers are so familiar with. And to aid that sort of work, it can preview your files “live”, even offline. While it can’t open and edit binary files like pictures, it can still download and display them&nbsp;fine.</p>
<p>For writing walls of text which don’t really need syntax highlighting (I wonder if someone has a package on mainstream text editors that syntax highlights free form English grammar, sort of like giving people synesthesia for no real reason), it includes a word count widget. Also, because I feel like encouraging unhealthy behavior, right next to the word count is an indication of your current typing speed. I’m pretty sure someone could go into some moral discussion into why it’s a completely detrimental addition to create something which displays how quickly the author is typing because it encourages a mindset which doesn’t focus on creating the most concise or effective means of delivery for some message, but rather promotes meaningless verbosity. But sometimes I would imagine using this for school assignments and the ilk, and maybe it would be nice to know when I’m reaching my designated quota filling some unwritten word requirement. I’m not quite sure how reliable of a word count it gives, since the algorithm is primitive and by no means nuanced, but it should be able to give a sort of rough estimate of the number of words on a&nbsp;page.</p>
<p>I may have mentioned earlier that there are two primary systems for interacting with the application, both of which are keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl-O and Ctrl-P, meaning the file browser and the command palette, respectively. They both appear in the same sort of interface component and generally behave the same, but there are some slight differences in how they operate (obviously). There are actually two “browsing modes” for the file browser, where it shows files either from the local stored cache or online in Dropbox. That can be switched by selecting either “Browse Mode: Local Copy” or “Browse Mode: Remote Dropbox” from the command palette (though there should probably be some better interface logically placed on the file browser panel itself). Remote Dropbox only works when the user is online, so the default mode is the local one. The sole interface to this list of files is the filter search box on the bottom of that widget, where typing in stuff filters out things. Of the visible items, the cursor can be manipulated by using the arrow keys, and one of the options can be executed by hitting the enter key. The widget needs to be manually dismissed by hitting the Esc key (which allows you to semi-rapidly open several files or try different commands, like changing themes). When a folder is activated, the context then shifts to what is inside the folder, descending into the hierarchy. It’s possible to ascend by entering the directory “../“. To create a file or folder (Note that at time of writing, creating folders does not sync to Dropbox), just type “+yourfile.txt” (or if there are no search results, it’ll automatically select the option to create a file with that name). To delete a file, you likewise just prepend your command with a minus instead, for instance “-oldfile.txt”. It’s not nearly as counterintuitive or confusing as I presume this description is making it&nbsp;sound.</p>
<p>The command palette, given that the interface is basically the same has much in common with the file system, but it’s entirely flat and linear. It lacks the hierarchy that plagues the file system, and navigating it is considerably simpler. Since the list is filtered and updated live with every keystoke, it’s fairly easy to find whatever command you’re looking for. The filtering algorithm only searches for characters but disregards gaps, only paying attention to order. In other words, the query “seals”, may match “SEt SyntAx: coLdfuSion”, it also means that you can construct very short queries to find what you&nbsp;want.</p>
<p>At this point, I don’t think it’s a final project per se, there are still a few features are woefully dysfunctional like Find and Replace. But I think it fits my own use case, editing files on my Chromebook, even when offline. It’s fast and doesn’t take too many steps to start. But the interface isn’t exceedingly intuitive (Basically everything is accessed through two keyboard shortcuts). I haven’t found a witty logo for it (I just haven’t bothered looking), and at this point I’m just writing a blog post about it because I feel obligated to document whatever it is that I just&nbsp;did.</p>
<p>Maybe some day I’ll pick it up again, or if there’s some response at all to this blog post, and add those awesome collaboration features (which probably won’t be very useful because the entire thing is quite hackish and not particularly kind to the prospect of improvements). Maybe I’ll fix up the search and replace interface (read: get rid of whatever horrid mess exists and replace it with a new one from scratch). And maybe I might publish it in some form that is significantly less involved than <a href="https://github.com/antimatter15/cloudfall">cloning off github</a> and packaging the app&nbsp;yourself.</p>
