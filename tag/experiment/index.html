              and this is my obligatory online presence or whatever.  
            </p>
            <p>This is my little corner of the internet, where I talk about random projects and ideas and stuff. </p>

<p>I guess it’s a trivia site and I’m never actually going to legitimately finish this <span class="caps">README</span>, as it’s substantially over 3,000 words and I haven’t even finished the introduction to the prequel. I might as well distill the whole thing down to what actually matters— the little bits of trivia that really don’t matter but might be amusing to some people with particularly derranged senses of&nbsp;amusement.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The official about page says that Protobowl is a portmanteau of “Prototype Quizbowl Application”, but this is in fact a lie. It is in fact and has always been an acronym for Promoting Racism Online To Obstruct Better Organized World Leadership. It was always designed to be nothing less than a <a href="http://www.qbwiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Protobowl&amp;oldid=22538">“literal cancer of the quizbowl community”</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Protobowl’s live-as-you-type real time chat was inspired by Google Wave, which Kevin is quite embarassed to have spent the first half of high school playing with, almost as embarrassed as he feels right now writing about himself in third&nbsp;person.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Protobowl was going to have a social component (called Socialbowl) so that users could log in and view their scores and detailed performance stats with graphs depicting buzz rates per category. Ben stopped working on it before it launched, so it was never&nbsp;added.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Protobowl runs primarily on Nodejitsu, but falls back to a Bitcable <span class="caps">VPS</span>, and then to an MIT XVM if all hell breaks loose. In late 2012, Ben and I had a bet over whether or not he would get into the Science Honor Society, and whoever lost would have to pay for the operational costs of Protobowl for the rest of time. He got accepted and lost the&nbsp;bet.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For a long time (and probably still today, albeit hopefully less so), Protobowl suffered from a mysterious lag problem that we could never quite figure out. In the process of debugging it, we instituted a bunch of voodoo superstitious policies under semi-credible conjectures. For the possibility that it might be due to increasing memory pressure due to a small memory leak, Protobowl restarts every day at 4am <span class="caps">EST</span> every day. The time was chosen because it represents the time of day with the fewest online&nbsp;users.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Protobowl has a built-in chat bot which is the remanant of a chat bot I had built in middle school for Omegle. It can be triggered by going into any empty room and saying (in chat) “I’m lonely”. It’s mostly reflective of the hornier, angstier and shallower side of online chat rooms, so it’s unlikely to pass a turing test (even if it decides to answer “asl” with “18 f&nbsp;uk”. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Protobowl was made using Twitter Bootstrap, which for quite a while was the blandest theme you could find on the internet because everyone who couldn’t design thought it looked beautiful. But now Bootstrap has itself become enamored with flat design, and Protobowl looks clean and original again with its soft gradients and gentle rounded&nbsp;corners. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Protobowl stores active rooms in-memory as simple Javascript objects. Inactive rooms are saved in a MongoDB database so that they can be unfrozen when requested. Questions are stored in an entirely separate MongoDB&nbsp;database. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="version-3">Version&nbsp;3</h2>
<p>The current version of Protobowl which lies before you is the “third” version. By that, I mean these version numbers don’t mean much more than significant changes to the core of protobowl. Version 3 constituted more or less an entire rewrite to the codebase with specific attention paid to offline-first and abstracting away the socket layer. The result is something which is, at least architecturally, pretty cool. A rather large amount of code is shared between client and server, such that the transition between online and offline and back is super&nbsp;seamless.</p>
<h1 id="readme-anachronisms"><span class="caps">README</span> <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;Anachronisms</h1>
<p>Okay, so I think <span class="caps">NPM</span> would complain if I didn’t have a readme, so I guess I’ll start writing something which might be mistaken for a readme given a certain number of prior conditions. As you might figure out in the “Prototype Quizbowl Application” section, the core of protobowl has evolved significantly during the life of this readme, and especially because I’m so insistent on writing pseudo-literary fluff in lieu of helpful concise manuals and bullets, there’s a good chance that the vast majority of the readme will be rife with anachronisms, statements that once were true, were falsified, returned to truthfulness and then fell into a stasis of&nbsp;untruth. </p>
<h1 id="manual">Manual</h1>
<p>Okay, so this application probably ranks among one of the largest things I’ve ever done, which actually does say something as to its scope. However, it’s still designed to be fast and responsive and what&nbsp;not.</p>
<p>But it’s got a somewhat large scope which makes me believe that it may be useful to have a sort of overview not of how things work (that’s what the code is for), but a somewhat deeper look into what it does. What kinds of features and little&nbsp;tricks.</p>
<h2 id="responsive-design">Responsive&nbsp;Design</h2>
<p>Yeah, yeah, buzzwords galore. It’s responsively designed which means that it should, at least in theory, work on all screen sizes, from gigantic monitor walls of 60 <span class="caps">HD</span> displays (I’ve only tested the application on six WXQGA monitors) to an iPhone screen (I won’t venture any smaller, because running on watches represents a significant effort beyond what I already&nbsp;have).</p>
<p>It’s been tested on a few browsers, Chrome (on Linux, Windows, iPad, Galaxy Nexus) and Firefox and Safari on&nbsp;iPad. </p>
<p>It’s built with Twitter Bootstrap, sans fugly black bar on top, so it should inherit most of the responsiveness. Also, it uses Font Awesome for all glyphs and that means everything’s vector and smooth even at absurd pixel&nbsp;densities.</p>
<h2 id="offline">Offline</h2>
<p>Protobowl was designed first with a flexible sync architecture. However, regrettably, it wasn’t designed with the idea of Offline-first. Don’t get me wrong, offline works great, but it’s implemented with a offline.coffee which is largely (I’d say 80%) a reimplementation of methods in web.coffee. That’s not a good quantity of don’t repeat yourself, or at least it’s hardly&nbsp;ideal.</p>
<p>However, by virtue of running off Node, there’s a single language (javascript) which runs both client and server. As such there’s a natural ability to reuse some code, in this case, all the supporting libraries are shared between client and server, the answer checking (which is surprisingly sophisticated, albeit likely unnecessarily&nbsp;so). </p>
<p>Offline was built with Appcache in mind, that’s pretty obvious because you sort of need appcache to make things work offline. The offline code is loaded asynchronously and there isn’t any fundamental difference between offline-start and disconnect behavior. So that means there isn’t any fumbling between multiple copies of the code or any limitation on the functionality of the offline mode. You can disconnect from the server in the midst of the game, perhaps because of a flaky connection and you can continue without interruption. And it even tries to automatically reconnect, and picks up the state and resumes (albeit, probably losing what you’ve done&nbsp;offline).</p>
<p>I have a sort of wordsy packrat syndrome, so I’ll leave all the text above untarnished, and state plainly that none of the words above are true, not anymore at least. Version 3 was a rewrite of the entire core of protobowl: client, server, heaven and earth. And to make the architecture more clean and gody, I endeavored to share code between client and server in a pretty cool&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>I don’t think this is meant to be a technical exposé of the artistic symmetries in the yet-unmade <span class="caps">UML</span> diagram of the universe, but I’ll talk about it a bit anyway, at least long enough for this document to hit the 3000 word&nbsp;mark. </p>
<h2 id="interface">Interface</h2>
<p>This is what I really think matters, how to actually use it, and the little interaction&nbsp;features.</p>
<h3 id="keyboard">Keyboard</h3>
<p>The primary interface is meant to be the keyboard. In fact, early design sketches didn’t even include a button bar for the desktop <span class="caps">UI</span>. Eventually, I relented, and there’s now buttons, but still, use&nbsp;keyboards.</p>
<p>The first button is <code>space</code>, which make sense because it’s the biggest button and also probably the most important. Space generally means “buzz”, however there’s another very small thing it does: when you open up and see that big green button saying “start the game”, you can also press space to trigger that (no ambiguity since the buzz button is disabled in such&nbsp;circumstances).</p>
<p>Next, or skipping, as it was referred to in earlier iterations, is also a fairly commonplace operation. It can be accessed with not one, but three keys, <code>S</code>, <code>N</code> and <code>J</code>. <code>S</code> and <code>N</code> are probably pretty obvious, referring to “Skip” and “Next”. J is just convenient because it’s on the home row (well, so is <code>S</code>, technically) and usually refers to “down” for people who use Vi or Vim, although it is commonplace for websites to respect <code>j</code> meaning up, and <code>k</code> meaning down. (See: Facebook, all Google products,&nbsp;etc.)</p>
<p>You can pause and resume with <code>P</code> and <code>R</code>. Both are equivalent, so you can technically pause with <code>R</code>, and resume with <code>P</code>, though that would be metaphorically&nbsp;confusing. </p>
<p>Since it’s designed to be “social”, if you don’t mind me tossing around more loaded buzzwords, chat was one of the first features added (also one of the easiest, but that doesn’t help me rewrite history). Chat is accessed through the <code>/</code> key, that is, the forward slash or by pressing enter while not buzzed. For those who don’t like letters which aren’t in the alphabet, it’s also accessible through the letter <code>C</code>.</p>
<h3 id="buttons">Buttons</h3>
<p>Yeah, buttons, they exist. But they’re only meant to be used on mobile. Seriously, use your&nbsp;keyboard.</p>
<h3 id="other-things-you-can-click-on">Other things you can click&nbsp;on</h3>
<p>There are a number of non-button things which can be clicked on as&nbsp;well.</p>
<h4 id="breadcrumbs">Breadcrumbs</h4>
<p>The “breadcrumb”, as Bootstrap calls it, is the little row which precedes every question which includes the category, difficulty and tournament to which the question belongs. The one on the top isn’t clickable, but all the other ones are. Clicking on those expands the question readout which gets collapsed below&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Within the breadcrumb is a slightly grayed out word “Report”, which can be clicked on to bring up a (currently non-functional) modal dialog to submit a question for manual review in case there was something wrong with the question. For instance, maybe the question was formatted wrong or truncated, or you’re exceedingly pedantic and think that there is a typo which hinders your ability to participate, or&nbsp;something.</p>
<p>Also, on the far right is a blue star which can be clicked on to “bookmark” a question. Right now, bookmarking does little other than filling in that blue star and preventing the question from getting deleted (questions that drop far enough down get deleted unless they’re bookmarked). However, in the future, it may be imaginable that the bookmarked questions would be added to some kind of interface which could be managed by the&nbsp;server.</p>
<p>The breadcrumb also reveals the answer to the question whenever the question is&nbsp;over.</p>
<h4 id="leaderboard-statistics">Leaderboard/Statistics</h4>
<p>In multiplayer mode, there is a leaderboard showing a ranking of all the users who have participated in the room. In single player, it’s just a single grid giving your&nbsp;statistics.</p>
<h5 id="multiplayer">Multiplayer</h5>
<p>It’s a grid, which is pretty cool, the first row is the ranking and the score, the latter of which is inside a bubble which is colored. The score is at the moment computed based on the number of “early” answers, which are correct answers before the asterisk in applicable packets, the number of interrupts and the number of correct answers. The current weights are 15 for an early answer, 10 for a correct answer and -5 for an interrupt. The colors of the bubble denote the online status of the&nbsp;player:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>gray</code> the user is offline and has no connected sessions at that&nbsp;moment</li>
<li><code>orange</code> the user has not interacted with the game in the past 10 minutes, but has at least one session&nbsp;open</li>
<li><code>green</code> the user is online and has interacted with the room in the past 10&nbsp;minutes</li>
<li><code>blue</code> this row corresponds to&nbsp;you</li>
</ul>
<p>On the adjacent column is the user’s name and there is another column for the number of interrupts. There aren’t any more because there isn’t much&nbsp;space.</p>
<p>Clicking on any of the rows brings up a popover which gives a more complete breakdown of the user and his or her performance. That dialog can be dismissed by clicking (or tapping, for touch devices) again on the same&nbsp;row.</p>
<h5 id="single-player-offline">Single&nbsp;Player/Offline</h5>
<p>The single player mode has aesthetic similarities to the detailed popover of the multiplayer mode and this is hardly a coincidence. The default view for single player mode is just an abridged version of the popover’s view including only the score, the number correct, the number of interrupts and the total number of guesses. Clicking on the single player interface anywhere will reveal the more detailed interface (with purty sliding effects courtesy of&nbsp;jQuery).</p>
<p>On the single player header the “offline” badge lights up, well, quite obviously, when the user is&nbsp;offline.</p>
<p>It also has shiny transitions between single player and multiplayer&nbsp;modes.</p>
<h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>
<p>The debugging panel is the furthest down and takes the form of what looks like a table. The first two rows sound vaguely technical (with an underscore too!), latency and sync_offset. And you’d be right, they’re both just little metrics which go indicate the health of the network&nbsp;connection. </p>
<p>The titling of “Debugging” is a tad disingenuous, it’s mostly networking. But then again, networking is like the vast majority of what can actually&nbsp;fail. </p>
<p>The very last in the menu is a link that quite plainly says “Disconnect”, and opposite is a piece of text representing the application cache’s status. Disconnect is nice for when the network’s flakey and you know your connection won’t last long anyway. Or if you’re like antisocial and need to make your own little corner to cry in. Or something like that. Sure. Okay.&nbsp;Next.</p>
<h3 id="the-main-interface">The Main&nbsp;Interface</h3>
<p>I think I’m going to start over with this&nbsp;manual.</p>
<h1 id="blog-post">Blog&nbsp;Post</h1>
<p>For the past few weeks, I’ve been working on a project which was tentatively titled “Protobowl”, short for “Prototype Quizbowl Application”. And that probably suffices as some sort of cursory description of what it is, it’s an app which tries to mimic the experience of a quiz bowl competition online. Most importantly, it was designed for multiplayer from day&nbsp;one.</p>
<h2 id="backstory">Backstory</h2>
<p>The github page for this project was created two weeks ago at time of writing, but the history of the project actually extends much further back. For the past two years, I’ve been a member of my school’s quiz bowl team, not a particularly illustrious team, but like any non-dysfunctional organization, we do have a sense of enthusiasm for the game. I’ve wanted to do something which had something to do with it for a while, but never found a sufficient impetus to do it until late in&nbsp;May.</p>
<p>On May 25th of this year, I was introduced to the website quizbowldb.com which has a pretty cool question reader. My friend, who belongs to a team which is significantly better (as an understatement) was using that tool to prepare for a tournament. I spent a few minutes looking at the site and felt mildly disappointed that multiplayer didn’t work, but at least I found some niche that was worth catering&nbsp;to.</p>
<h3 id="bayesian-classifier">Bayesian&nbsp;Classifier</h3>
<p>The first thing which needed to be done was getting some set of labeled questions for the database. I looked around and found a few sources but most of them weren’t really large or labeled. I had finished the online <span class="caps">AI</span> class a few months ago, and felt like applying it in a fairly obvious scenario, so over the course of the next few hours I built a simple naive bayesian classifier to give categories to&nbsp;questions. </p>
<p>But, in order to do that, I had to first have some manually labeled corpus. I certainly wasn’t up for the tedium, so I decided to pull some from the quizbowldb.com site to seed the algorithm. At that point in time, for some reason, I was using some preview release of Windows 8 and rather regrettably couldn’t use wget. But I coped by writing a short python script (rather than the more reasonable solution of rebooting into another operating system) which would incrementally clone the site’s&nbsp;database. </p>
<p>Because of rate limiting or something to that effect, the script only pulled about 10 questions every 40 seconds, and given that there were 30,000 questions in the database, the process wasn’t terribly fast. I eventually booted back into linux and rewrote the script so that it was resumable (for the event that the script might be interrupted for some reason on its scheduled week-long&nbsp;run). </p>
<p>However, by the next day, some number of them were downloaded and that small number was enough to train the classifier. The first thing was trying to run the classifier on the question set itself and comparing how well it fared. The results were actually surprisingly good, and after careful combing through the exceptions, it appeared that most of the errors manifested from the manual mislabeling of the original&nbsp;corpus. </p>
<p>After that initial successful result, I did a bit of work on a question extraction algorithm which would use the command line version of Abiword to convert .doc and .docx files that packets are usually distributed as into some machine readable format for feeding into the classifier. However, I never quite finished that, as school work caught up with me and I waited for the database to finish&nbsp;downloading.</p>
<h3 id="hiatus">Hiatus</h3>
<p>On June 7th, about two weeks after I built the first promising prototype of the question parser, I had noticed that the background task had finished. Actually, it finished something like a week earlier, but I hadn’t noticed. Lurking around through Wikipedia, I discovered that Roger Craig, the famed Jeopardy! contestant who wrote a program to help study had actually attended my high&nbsp;school.</p>
<p>But nothing really happened after that. The school year was nearing a close and the after school clubs were having their last meetings of the year. There was the standardized testing and the anxiety about the imminent end of the year, and I had other projects which seemed more enticing at the time. Narrower in scope and more doable in shorter periods of time. This app was always on the radar, it just gradually slipped further and further&nbsp;back.</p>
<h3 id="it-s-ac-attack">It’s Ac&nbsp;Attack</h3>
<p>I wasn’t the only person in my school’s quiz bowl team who was interested in pursuing the idea. In fact, it was Ben who actually started the app first. I didn’t write code for the actual project until two weeks&nbsp;ago.</p>
<p>Early in July (or possibly late in June), Ben wanted to build that quiz bowl application when I was still working on a few other projects as well as an internship. I gave him the big <span class="caps">JSON</span> file of questions and he toiled away for the next few days, experimenting first with Ruby on Rails and then later settling with Node.JS (and the accompanying popular&nbsp;stacks). </p>
<p>Within a few days, he had put out a pretty impressive application using Mongoose, Jade, Twitter Bootstrap, Express, and Node running on Heroku at the (now defunct) its-ac-attack <span class="caps">URL</span>. Soon afterwards search was fairly functional and I started to take an interest in the project again (having almost finished another project, though at time of writing, I have yet to begin writing the blog post for that&nbsp;project).</p>
<p>I felt like exploiting this opportunity to get acquainted somewhat with popular NodeJS frameworks and tools. I haven’t done much with Node for over two years, and the landscape has changed considerably in the intervening years. It’s a fast growing and developing community. However, I never really found interest in building the entire app. Managing users and doing search has always struck me as somewhat boring, in part because it’s hardly untreaded&nbsp;territory.</p>
<p>I wanted to skip straight into the low latency websocket-driven synchronized multiplayer. Ben was still acclimating to the multimodal (if I’m using these buzzwords right) paradigm of writing code meant to be executed on both the client and the server, so I decided to prototype a multiplayer&nbsp;environment.</p>
<h2 id="prototype-quizbowl-application">Prototype Quizbowl&nbsp;Application</h2>
<p>Chronologically, this places us at about two weeks ago. That’s actually quite confusing because I wrote that sentence a bit over a month ago, where “a month ago” means August 8th, and “now” means September 12th. That is, you can imagine the gap between the first sentence in this paragraph and the sentence immediately succeeding it as joined by that scene from Monty Python where the animator dies of some fatal heart attack, in which case that animator is me, and I just sort of gave up on writing the&nbsp;readme. </p>
<p>And just like that, in the blink of a sentence, it’s been another&nbsp;month. </p>

<p>So I was testing the responsiveness of the Samsung Series 5 Chromebook touchpad and made a short little script which basically continuously adds the mousewheel changes and draws them using canvas. But it appears that the trackpad does some kind of fitting to make things tend to be at right angles, though it’s not hard to get something diagonal or even somewhat&nbsp;circular.</p>

<p>So here’s a somewhat technical post, actually it’s pretty technical. But either way the premise is sort of simple to understand, and probably so is the context. I’m working on Swipe Gesture 2.0, which basically tries to take Chrome and Safari on <span class="caps">OS</span> X Lion’s awesome back-forward transitions and make them work on other operating systems. See, the thing is that multitouch isn’t _strictly _a requirement for it to work, a lot of computers just have the little bars on the bottom and right of the track bar (often with a little somewhat abrasive textured surface so you don’t accidentally tread upon it). Regardless, the title is a bit of a misnomer, because even though the event is called the “mousewheel”, it’s hardly meant to be observed from an actual mouse (or a wheel), instead it means the scrolling gesture on some kind of trackpad, either multitouch or&nbsp;not.</p>
<p>Well, first, I guess I’ll talk about the difference between how Lion and Leopard do it. The way Leopard did it was pretty cool but not particularly applicable to other platforms since it relied on the existence of a three-finger gesture. As in, you needed some kind of touchpad which was cool enough to support three-finger multiouch, <em>reliably</em>. It also behaved completely independent of the current zoom or scroll position, which makes implementation in software entirely trivial given access to some drivers which can recognize three fingers on a&nbsp;touchpad.</p>
<p>Lion did it a completely different way. Instead of creating an entirely new gesture which was entirely dedicated to the singular task of navigating through history, it conflated the notions of scrolling with navigating, which sort of makes sense. Apple’s quite dedicated to skeuomorphic metaphors, and they want to treat the web more like <em>literal pages</em>. A user can move it around to better keep certain things in view, and the physical movement to slide a sheet out of view is just an extension of that panning&nbsp;gesture.</p>
<p>However, technically this poses a completely different challenge, because this requires you to distinguish between scrolls and navigation requests. Scrolling is always the default behavior, but the navigation swipe gesture happens when scrolling wouldn’t actually result in anything. However, many implementations of scrolling are at least somewhat kinetic, often it’s emphasized in software (in the form of smooth-scrolling) or hardware (scroll wheels that don’t click but instead move basically freely) or because your arm has to obey the laws of kinematics (unless it doesn’t, in which case that’s certainly fascinating). So not only does the software have to determine when a mouse wheel action results manifests as a scroll, it has to see if it was the user’s intent to do the extraneous&nbsp;scrolling.</p>
<p>This is done by clustering the mouse wheel movements together temporally. Scroll events flow in in discrete chunks, and you can split events off into little buckets (in a sense), where if there isn’t any event sent within some arbitrary threshold (say, 500msecs or half a second), you stick stuff in a new bucket. This way, lets say you scroll from the top of the page to the bottom and you’re sort of excited, and spin the wheel as fast as possible, you hit the bottom of the page but it’s not some instant stop. You continue scrolling (because you’re just that excited, and just can’t stop) for a little bit more. Ignoring the fact that you probably won’t have a vertical/horizontal event handler (though there are some sort of intriguing possibilities for this, one idea is to have the upper threshold trigger full screen). Without segmenting them into certain buckets, it doesn’t recognize that the time when you’re ramming into the top of the page is part of the same general gesture as when you were scrolling, and it may interpret that as an intentional gesture. So that’s one part which makes it a bit more&nbsp;complex.</p>
<p>So now, you have these series of <code>mousewheel</code> events conveniently delimited into little gesture-chunks. The next part is determining whether or not the gesture-chunks are part of a scroll action or&nbsp;not.</p>
<p>Thankfully that’s a really simple thing to do. Just look at the document’s scrollTop and check if it’s zero (or scrollLeft for horizontal stuff) or whatever value is the width of the element. If it can’t scroll no more, then you have a winner and you can start the falling balloons and&nbsp;confetti.</p>
<p>Except it’s not that easy, because the document isn’t the only thing which can scroll. Thanks to the glory of <code>overflow:scroll</code>, there are lots of things which can scroll. Things which aren’t necessarily documents may be in arbitrary scroll positions to wreak havoc on your well-meaning&nbsp;heuristics.</p>
<p>So back to the drawing board, I guess. Actually, to think of it, maybe it’s simpler to listen for the <code>scroll</code> event, which fires when a scroll happens, and quite intuitively doesn’t fire when a scroll doesn’t happen. And mouse wheel actions always precede scroll ones (because the wheel events bubble and are cancelable, so you can prevent a scroll from happening). The only problem is that scroll events don’t bubble. As in, when a scroll event happens on some element, it’s not going to show up on the document, it’s only going to show up if you’re listening on that specific element at the right point in&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>The naive approach to this dilemma is just to attach a scroll listener to every single event on the document, and to reattach to some other elements whenever the <span class="caps">DOM</span> tree is modified in some way. This means the overhead grows rather significantly when pages are larger, in a way which could be likened to O(n) time where n represents the number of nodes in the document. If you want, you could lazily do it by attaching the scroll listener only once the wheel event has fired, but that would cause a significant delay when attempting to legitimately&nbsp;scroll.</p>
<p>Another thing you could do, is to make another assumption: that the element which gets scrolled has to be some parent of the element which the mouse is currently over. Making that assumption, we can add a <code>mousewheel</code> listener to the root of the document, as those kinds of events actually do bubble. And since they’re mouse events, once you capture it, you can get a <code>clientX</code> and <code>clientY</code>, comprising the current coordinates of the mouse. And with that, you can get the element immediately below the cursor with <code>document.elementFromPoint</code>. And since the scroll might fire on any one of the elements which are parents of the current element, you ascend up the tree and add a listener on all of those (until, of course you hit the document element, at which point you can’t go any further up). This yields performance which could essentially be modeled with O(log n), quite a bit better than&nbsp;O(n).</p>
<p>So now the finished process is fairly simple, you listen for a mousewheel event, and when it happens we determine the element, and ascend the tree, yada yada. That scroll listener, when fired, sets a global variable <code>lastDetectedScroll</code> to the current timestamp. We set a little temporary variable set to the before time and then we set a little timer, 150 milliseconds. It usually only takes like four to see if a scroll thingy happened, but let’s be safe by having an order-of-magnitude threshold. The Cuckoo clock rings, and we check if the <code>lastDetectedScroll</code> is the same thing, and if it is, it’s a swipe, and otherwise, it’s a&nbsp;scroll.</p>
<p>Here’s a little demo: <a href="http://antimatter15.com/misc/experiments/swipe-gesture/minimal.html">http://antimatter15.com/misc/experiments/swipe-gesture/minimal.html</a></p>

<p>One thing the ajax animator’s pretty bad at is stick figures. Sure it’s not impossible, but it can’t really compare with the ol-fashioned frame-by-frame joint-manipulation likeness of <a href="http://www.google.com/images?client=ubuntu&amp;channel=cs&amp;q=pivot&amp;qscrl=1&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;source=univ&amp;ei=GF0hTJejE4H98AaJ0qxg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=image_result_group&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDQQsAQwAw">Pivot</a>. It’s called stick2 because the <a href="/2010/06/stick-figure-animator/2010/02/stick-figures/">original experiment </a>with stickfigures was named stick.html, and when I went to extend it and didn’t feel like setting up a git/svn repo, I copied the file and named it stick2.html, and with no good project-naming skills, it stayed that&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>Anyway, this was a project that got pretty close to completion in early march, but I never bothered to blog about it until now. It should work pretty not-bad on an iPad J(except the color picker), though honestly, I’ve never tried&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The interface is pure jQuery/html/css. The graphics are done with Raphael, but the player actually uses &lt;canvas&gt; for no particular&nbsp;reason.</p>
<p>Basically, it’s organized into two panels, the left-side figures-box and the bottom timeline. The figures-box contains figures (amazing!) and clicking on them adds them to your canvas. The two defaults are the pivot-style stickman, and something called “blank” which is a root node with no additional nodes. Though it shows up as a orange dot, unless you add something to it, it doesn’t have any actual look when viewed in the&nbsp;player.</p>
<p>On top is the context-sensitive buttons. Well the buttons in my screenshot aren’t context sensitive, they’re permanent. But when you click on a node, a new set of buttons (and words too!) appears. One is a line and the other is a circle. Click them to add a new segment or circle to the currently selected node. Then are various settings for the current segment (each node other than the root one is associated with a segment). Clicking those allows you to modify them. Also, a red X appears on the right, and that basically means remove the node and the child&nbsp;nodes.</p>
<p>So, now you have some extra nodes, how do you change them? Simply hold it down and drag, and the the segments move as well. But note that the length of the segment doesn’t change as you move it. That’s because by default, it locks the length of the segments. There are two ways to get around it. The first is to hold shift while dragging. The second is to tap the little lock icon on the top&nbsp;left.</p>
<p>On the bottom, is the timeline with live-previews of your frames with a semitransparent gray backdrop of numbers. Switch between each one by clicking on them and add one at the end by hitting the green “Add new frame”&nbsp;button.</p>
<p>On the canvas, there are two yellow squares, those allow you to resize the&nbsp;canvas.</p>
<p>On the very left of the top toolbar, is the play button. Hit it and the figures toolbox minimizes and it plays out your animation. Click it again to get back. Then is a little upload button. Hit it and then a little box pops up with a link to where you can find your animation in a way that you can share and to edit (not actually edit, but more like fork, as each save is given a unique id). Next is the download button which you hit, and get prompted by a big prompt-box which you use to paste in the <span class="caps">ID</span> of the animation you (or someone else) has saved, so you can edit it. Most of the time that’s useless as when you send a link with the player, it has a button which says&nbsp;“Edit”.</p>

            </header>
            <section class="content"><p>Today I went to the magical Apple Store and tried out the iPad for the first time. I really have to say that it’s quite magical, though it doesn’t fulfill the criterion for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke’s Third Law</a> despite what <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/#video">Jonathan Ive</a> says. Though I really haven’t tried any large area multitouch interface before (sadly), and I would expect it to be a somewhat similar if not exact replica of the experience. Keynote and Numbers were pretty neat (I suck at typing on the iPad in any orientation, so I don’t like Pages). That’s enough to show that iPad is not just a content consumption tool as the iPod and iPhone primarily are, but also content&nbsp;creation.</p>
<p>Anyway, in a few minutes I just swapped the mousedown, mousemove, mouseup events with touchstart, touchmove, touchend events respectively in the core of VectorEditor, while adding a new MobileSafari detection script (var mobilesafari = /AppleWebKit.*Mobile/.test(navigator.userAgent);) and in a quite analogous “magical” way, V<a href="http://code.google.com/p/jsvectoreditor/source/detail?r=202">ectorEditor works in iPhone/iPod Touch</a> and theoretically iPad, Just dragging the vectoreditor files over to the Ajax Animator folder and recompiling should bring iPad support to Ajax Animator with virtually no&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>I haven’t tested it. Downloading XCode 3.2.2 right now so hopefully I can test it soon. Stupid how it’s what? 2.31&nbsp;gigabytes?!</p>
<p>And possibly, I could use PhoneGap to hack together a App Store app which does the same thing (and maybe charge for it, which might be a bit cruel as this application is open source and works equivalently online - but I guess that’s okay for those people who don’t read my blog &gt;:) ). Maybe get enough to buy an iPad&nbsp;:P</p>
<p>Anyway, though I’m pretty late to this and my opinion probably doesn’t matter at all, here’s a mini iPad review: It’s really really cool, feels sort of heavy, really expensive, hard to type on in any orientation (interestingly it has that little linke on the f and j keys with the keyboard which feels useless since I always thought the point of that was so you can tactile-ily or haptically or tactically or whatever the right word is, find the home row, but since there’s no physical dimension to an iPad, it just strikes me as weird and wanting of that tactile keyboard). Otherwise, browsing really really feels great. Only thing I miss is the Macbook Pro style 3 finger forward/backward gestures (@<span class="caps">AAPL</span> plz add this before iPad2.0, and also, get iPhoneOS 4.0 to work on my iPhone 2g or at least @DevTeam plz hack 4.0 for the&nbsp;2g!).</p>
<p>Oh, and for those lucky enough to have a magical iPad, the <span class="caps">URL</span> is <a href="http://antimatter15.com/ajaxanimator/ipad/">http://antimatter15.com/ajaxanimator/ipad/</a> at least until there’s enough testing to make sure that I didn’t screw up everything with my MobileSafari&nbsp;hacks.</p>

            <section class="content"><p>I was experiementing with using another framework for Vector editing. So I used the relatively new Raphael framework. I wanted to use dojo.gfx, but I still don’t know how to use it without the dojo dependency. Raphael is not as powerful as dojo.gfx, or even OnlyPaths… so, it needs&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>It has many of the features in OnlyPaths, but it keeps the core showTracker() and such functions in the main script, not in the renderer. That allows the system to be simpler, and more easily&nbsp;cross-platform.</p>
<p>I’m not currently using cross-platform event handling. so it only works in Firefox for now, but converting is&nbsp;easy.</p>
