              Hi. I’m <b>Kevin Kwok</b>, and I’m currently a sophomore at <b>MIT</b>, 
              and this is my obligatory online presence or whatever.  
            </p>
            <p>
              I regularly updated this site from 2007, when I started it in elementary school, 
              to summer 2014, when it was unwittingly absorbed into an international phishing ring.
            </p>
            <p>
              But like a phoenix, hydra or the national deficit, the site is back 
              again bigger than ever (after a rather long gestation period).
            </p>
            <p>
              For more obnoxious autobiographical content 
              blended with bits of nostalgia for the old PHP-on-sketchy-free-webhosting days, click here.

<p>Google Music Beta is a pretty cool web app, but the Music Manager sadly only works on Windows and Mac. As a Linux user who unfortunately feels neglected by the service, but still appreciative of being invited to the service a mere day after it’s announcement, I decided to do something to remedy the situation. Not to mention the irony that one can’t even upload music to the service from Google’s own Chrome <span class="caps">OS</span>. So <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/obojocfchdgdpgcigcdhdnlakfcbbgfn">MusicAlpha</a> was&nbsp;born.</p>
<p>This project was a pretty interesting hack, so I guess I’ll try to document the process of how I made it and how it currently works. And also, for any prospective filmmakers, this story might make for an interesting abstract action movie. But for any of you who just want to install the app, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/obojocfchdgdpgcigcdhdnlakfcbbgfn">click here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="inception">Inception</h2>
<p>I started this only days after finishing the new revision of Cloud Save, the extension that I never quite understood, but everyone else seemed to get. One part of the newest revision was adding support for Amazon’s Cloud Drive service, which does not have an established <span class="caps">API</span>. However, the interactions between the javascript web interface and the server are pretty simple to understand, thanks to the almighty web inspector. The only weird thing was that the actual file upload was actually conducted through Flash, which felt unnecessary but it wasn’t an insurmountable task. But it was all built on carefully learning the way of the web&nbsp;client.</p>
<p>There was one feature request for Cloud Save to enable saving to Google Music, and that’s when the idea sort of&nbsp;started.</p>
<p>The first step was to get a Google Music account, nothing surprising there. A few hours after the announcement was the first opportunity for me to access a computer, and also when I hit the “request invite” button. In a shockingly short amount of time of a mere day, I received a nice email saying that I had been invited to the service. Yay. Now the letdown of not being able to upload from Linux begins, as well as the scheming to reverse engineer&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>A few months ago, I had the idea to do something similar, but with another Google product: Google Goggles. But after hooking up the anrdoid simulator with a http proxy (Charles), and looking at the results. I was rather dismayed, but not particularly surprised by the results: all the communication was encoded using Protobuf. Protobuf, or Protocol Buffers is “Google’s data interchange format”, according to it’s Google Code project page. It’s a structured system for encoding binary data where a .proto template is already known and compiled. Protobufs are bad in much the same way minification is. There are totally justifiable reasons to minify source code, but the elimination of a useful View Source detracts from the open ideal of the web. Though protocol buffers aren’t encrypted, they are not comprehensible without a .proto file to decode them. With a lot of work, one might be able to reverse engineer a .proto file, but it’s certainly much harder than a <span class="caps">JSON</span>&nbsp;protocol.</p>
<p>Before I began, this was the worst fear. That everything as encoded with protocol buffers, and my attempts to mimic it would be rendered&nbsp;futile.</p>
<h2 id="packets">Packets</h2>
<p>I borrowed a computer which ran Windows 7, and installed the Music Manager in hopes of deciphering the secret enigma of the great google. I needed a simple packet sniffer, and so I used nirsoft’s smartsniff. I didn’t use wireshark because it wasn’t my computer, and I didn’t want to install and download a huge app with an intimidating user interface. Smartsniff worked pretty well, and I thought I was almost there. Packet sniffers generally can’t decode https data without some <span class="caps">MITM</span>-esque certificate faking, and I have reason to believe that that wouldn’t work either since running the strings command on the MusicManager.exe file includes something that resembles a public&nbsp;key.</p>
<p>Anyway, I found two raw unencrypted <span class="caps">HTTP</span> requests, and sort of fixated myself on those&nbsp;two.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="caps">POST</span> /uploadsj/rupio&nbsp;HTTP/1.1</p>
<p>User-Agent: Music Manager (1, 0, 12, 3443 -&nbsp;Windows)</p>
<p>Host:&nbsp;uploadsj.clients.google.com</p>
<p>Accept: <em>/</em></p>
<p>Cookie: <span class="caps">SID</span>=[redacted] domain=.google.com&nbsp;path=/</p>
<p>Expect:&nbsp;None</p>
<p>Content-Length:&nbsp;851</p>
<p>Content-Type:&nbsp;application/x-www-form-urlencoded</p>
<p>{“clientId”:”Jumper&nbsp;Uploader”,”createSessionRequest”:{“fields”:[{“inlined”:{“content”:”jumper-uploader-title-19Redacted”,”contentType”:”text/plain”,”name”:”title”}},</p>
<p>{“external”:{“filename”:”Redacted.mp3”,”name”:”C:\Users\Redacted.mp3”,”put”:{},”size”:610Redacted}},</p>
<p>{“inlined”:{“content”:”0”,”name”:”AlbumArtLength”}},</p>
<p>{“inlined”:{“content”:”0”,”name”:”AlbumArtStart”}},</p>
<p>{“inlined”:{“content”:”3rBe9dCa%c2tBeJdD”,”name”:”ClientId”}},</p>
<p>{“inlined”:{“content”:”00:1F:R3:<span class="caps">DA</span>:C7:ED”,”name”:”MachineIdentifier”}},</p>
<p>{“inlined”:{“content”:”5a5de21sd-54dsfe-Redacted”,”name”:”ServerId”}},</p>
<p>{“inlined”:{“content”:”true”,”name”:”SyncNow”}},</p>
<p>{“inlined”:{“content”:”153”,”name”:”TrackBitRate”}},</p>
<p>{“inlined”:{“content”:”false”,”name”:”TrackDoNotRematch”}}</p>
<p>]},”protocolVersion”:”0.8”}
I noticed the second request was rather huge, <span class="caps">3556KB</span>. Just enough to fit a normal-sized MP3. I knew what was in there.
PUT /uploadsj/rupio?upload_id=REDACTED&amp;file_id=000&nbsp;HTTP/1.1</p>
<p>User-Agent: Music Manager (1, 0, 12, 3443 -&nbsp;Windows)</p>
<p>Host:&nbsp;uploadsj.clients.google.com</p>
<p>Accept: <em>/</em></p>
<p>Cookie: <span class="caps">SID</span>=REDACTED domain=.google.com&nbsp;path=/</p>
<p>Content-Type:&nbsp;audio/mpeg</p>
<p>Expect:&nbsp;None</p>
<p>Content-Length:&nbsp;<span class="caps">3141REDACTED</span></p>
<p><span class="caps">ID3</span>…..%vTENC….@..WXXX……..TIT2……. Redacted
At this point, I was relatively ecstatic. Or at least, I will pretend that I was, because everything looked elegantly and remarkably simple. I had no idea where the upload_id came from, but I figured that it was part of the response from the first POST request. Part of the problem was that SmartSniff didn’t give me the actual responses to the HTTP requests, only the request data. Or at least from the five minutes that I bothered using it. The cookie looked like a generic cookie that would exist in a normal browser&nbsp;session.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="prototype">Prototype</h2>
<p>Since it used generic browser cookies, the simplest way to start would be to make a browser extension. Specifically, a Chrome App. That way, I could get the necessary permissions to do all the cross domain security protocol violations and probe around a bunch of requests. Since XHRs already include cookies for a specific domain, there’s nothing I need to do to set the cookies. I hoped and suspected that the User-Agent, Accept, and Expect headers were basically ignored, and the content-type would be rather trivial to&nbsp;set.</p>
<p>A lesson in premature optimization was the huge block of <span class="caps">JSON</span> which got sent with the first POST request. I had no idea what was really essential, so basically, I just deleted almost everything there except for what I thought might be really important: the file name and size. There were no errors in the POST request, so I figured it was okay to delete all of that stuff. I ran the POST and just as I suspected, the JSON that resulted included the upload_id, in fact, it included the entire PUT url, which was pretty&nbsp;nice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>{“sessionStatus”:{“state”:”<span class="caps">OPEN</span>”,”externalFieldTransfers”:[{“name”:”REDACTED.mp3”,”status”:”IN_PROGRESS”,”bytesTransferred”:0,”bytesTotal”:314REDACTED,”putInfo”:{“url”:”<a href="http://uploadsj.clients.google.com/uploadsj/rupio?upload_id=AEdREDACTED&amp;file_id=000&quot;},&quot;content_type&quot;:&quot;audio/mpeg&quot;}],&quot;upload_id&quot;:&quot;AEdREDACTED&quot;}}">http://uploadsj.clients.google.com/uploadsj/rupio?upload_id=AEdREDACTED&amp;file_id=000&quot;},&quot;content_type&quot;:&quot;audio/mpeg&quot;}],&quot;upload_id&quot;:&quot;AEdREDACTED&quot;}}</a>
Then, when I executed the subsequent <span class="caps">PUT</span> request. I was scared.
{“errorMessage”:{“reason”:”REQUEST_REJECTED”,”additionalInfo”:{“uploader_service.GoogleRupioAdditionalInfo”:{“completionInfo”:{“status”:”REJECTED”,”customerSpecificInfo”:{“ResponseCode”:404}},”requestRejectedInfo”:{“reasonDescription”:”agent_rejected”}}},”upload_id”:”AEdREDACTED”}}
Scary. The rejection reason was “agent_rejected”, which made me think about the User-Agent header, and I wondered if that was supposed to matter. If that did matter, then I would have to prototype it in a different language since XMLHttpRequests forbid the setting of the User-Agent and other headers for security reasons (even operating in a privledged&nbsp;environment!).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But thankfully, before attempting the drastic route, I pasted back in the alleged cruft, the jumper-uploader-title, TrackDoNotRematch, TrackBitRate, SyncNow, ServerId, MachineIdentifier, ClientID, AlbumArtStart (hey that rhymes!), and AlbumArtLength. Magically now, it worked.&nbsp;Yay.</p>
<h2 id="rupio">Rupio</h2>
<p>During my quest to understand the bizarre agent_rejected error (because I totally fear rejection, they should have used a nicer word), I tried googling GoogleRupioAdditionalInfo. (I had googled “Rupio” before, since that was part of the <span class="caps">POST</span> url, but that didn’t yield any relevant results, it just ended up being a bunch of people’s names). Searching GoogleRupioAdditionalInfo yielded a more limited subset which happened to be more&nbsp;interesting.</p>
<p>The first result, from the SMEStorage Blog described an error emitted by the Google Docs platform. The next result was on the Picasa help forums, about “Upload video results in Error”. Then was a french language forum which mentioned an error which included GoogleRupioAdditionalInfo, this time on the url&nbsp;“upload.youtube.com”.</p>
<p>So, it seems “Rupio” is the codename (or just the name, but it’s much more fun imagining that there are subliminal codes everywhere) of a unified Google data upload/storage platform. That’s pretty cool. It probably makes sense that they have a sort of unified file storage system across Google Docs, Picasa, and Youtube, since it would probably be easier to maintain a system which is internally consistent. But to inject a sensationalist twist where occam’s razor shows that it’s not justified, this is a hint at an upcoming unified Google file storage service. A sort of file-browser dashboard which links all media and document files together in an accessible and uniform&nbsp;manner.</p>
<h2 id="shiny">Shiny</h2>
<p>It worked. Or at least, it seemed to work. Vaguely. At this point, I was reasonably satisfied and began sculpting a nice pretty interface for it. Following my usual way, I just stole the Tango icon for an audio file mime type and built the entire interface around it. I remembered that earlier that day, I had discovered something called Layer Styles, which is a photoshop gradient/style clone that instead generates <span class="caps">CSS3</span> gradients. I thought that was cool and I remembered it, so I played around with it and made a centered rectangle. Gray on&nbsp;Gray.</p>
<p>I decided on a name for it: MusicAlpha. It’s a sort of play on how this Google product features Beta in a way which is much more prominently than usual, with the gray “beta” the same size as the actual “music”. The Alpha sort of says something about how it will almost eternally be stuck in this unstable and incomplete form. It also reminded me of one of my favorite websites: wolfram alpha, and how the logo is stylized WolframAlpha or&nbsp;Wolfram|Alpha.</p>
<p>I wanted it to be minimal, but I’ve since adopted the belief that drag-and-drop file selection was only a fad. Sure, it’s often really useful, but it’s not great to restrict to that. A hybrid approach is much better, and if you have to have only one, then the standard browse button is better since you can drag and drop files to that button (on chrome, anyway) without any special code. Drag and Drop is often quite terrible on laptops, and I’m not sure if you can even drag and drop files with Chrome <span class="caps">OS</span>, since the file browser might be&nbsp;modal.</p>
<p>There’s not much to the interface, it’s probably as minimal as it can get. Two links, one to the service, the other to me. A button. That’s&nbsp;it.</p>
<h2 id="dismay">Dismay</h2>
<p>At some point in every good story (not implying that this is a good story), there’s false hope, where the protagonist (not implying that I’m the protagonist here, either) believes that he or she (not implying that I’m a she) is closer to the end than is factually warranted (I’m actually implying that that’s exactly what happened). I checked the Google Music song list, and lo and behold, the song was&nbsp;there.</p>
<p>Sort of. Not really.<em> Something</em> was. Not sure it was a&nbsp;song.</p>
<p><a href="/articles/2011/MusicAlpha%20Upload%20to%20Google%20Music%20Beta%20from%20Linux%20and%20Chrome%20OS/Screenshot1.png"><img src="/articles/2011/MusicAlpha%20Upload%20to%20Google%20Music%20Beta%20from%20Linux%20and%20Chrome%20OS/Screenshot1-300x60.png" alt="" title="Screenshot"></a></p>
<p>There was a blank row. Double click it, and something does play. And it is the song. But, there’s no way to seek because incidentally, it doesn’t know how long the track is, so there’s no way to render the position of the&nbsp;song.</p>
<p>It was late, and this was frustrating, so I just posted a terse blog post announcing the beginning of the&nbsp;project:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So pretty soon, I hacked together something that almost sort of worked, with one rather significant caveat: It doesn’t pick up any tag data, name, time, artist, album, etc. I can’t figure out why. I guess I’ll try some more tomorrow.
And by the way, I totally lied. I didn’t try at all the next&nbsp;day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yesterday, that is, May 13th, the delightful Friday the Thirteenth, I tried again. I installed Music Manager on a VMWare installation of Windows <span class="caps">XP</span>, and sniffed the traffic with Wireshark running on the host computer. Didn’t notice anything new in the plethora of data which happened to get exchanged. I tried running smartsniff from the VM, but every time I tried to start sniffing, VMWare magically&nbsp;crashed.</p>
<h2 id="skyjam">SkyJam</h2>
<p>At this point, I thought of looking at the MusicManager.exe binary. Usually, binaries have some random strings in them, which you can look at to give some hint at what it does, without actually decompiling something. I’m now going to proceed to anachronistically mention something about android, because of a certain <span class="caps">URL</span> that I find out later in this chronology: android.clients.google.com. So I used strings MusicManager.exe | grep android, and found some rather interesting&nbsp;things</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2-.wireless_android_skyjam.CopyrightStatus.Type</p>
<p>2”.wireless_android_skyjam.ProductId</p>
<p>wireless_android_skyjam.Uits</p>
<p>Metadata.ParentalAdvisoryType
There appears to be 214 mentions of the phrase “skyjam” in the executable, which I assume is not some new solar powered Google sandwich filling distribution mechanism powered by artificial intelligence driven aeronautically mobile condiment dispensers (obviously using&nbsp;Arduinos).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have no idea what Skyjam is, but that’s totally a much cooler name than Google Music, regardless of how big you write “beta”. And what’s wireless_android_skyjam? Why is skyjam so deeply tied with wireless and android? Maybe it’s got something to do with flying robot sandwich machines. Or&nbsp;not.</p>
<p>Maybe it has something to do with that Simplify Media company which Google bought last year. Or maybe I’m just a little sad that the product ended. According to&nbsp;TechCrunch,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google <span class="caps">VP</span> Vic Gundotra said that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/20/um-did-google-just-quietly-launch-a-web-based-itunes-competitor-yep/#ixzz0oUJBJO3l">Simplify’s technology</a> will be used to offer a desktop app that will give you access to all of your (<span class="caps">DRM</span>-free) media on your Android devices remotely, using Google’s new iTunes competitor on the&nbsp;web.</p>
<p>&gt;
Desktop App: Check. Android: Check. New iTunes Competitor on the Web: Check. Simplify’s Technology: Not so&nbsp;much.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those who aren’t familiar with what Simplify did (which I assume is nigh everyone), it streamed your music by making your desktop into something of a server, so your huge cache of music can be accessible by any mobile device&nbsp;remotely.</p>
<h2 id="fishtank">Fishtank</h2>
<p>I had a random false lead. I thought that the server still read <span class="caps">ID3</span> data on itself, and noticed that the HTTP dump was somehow slightly different from the original file. It was the same length. The exact same length, but some of the bytes were different. Most were the same, and they were all in the same place, but for example, all 0x00’s seemed to have been swapped with 0xe4’s. Some other bytes were also different, and in retrospect this was probably because the program which created the http dump sucked and encoded all the bytes wrong or something. But I tried opening it up in Ghex and I swapped every 0xe4 with a 0x00, and magically the broken file now played, with one exception: the audio now sounded like a fishtank. It’s like everything’s just water, magestically moving around with exquisite&nbsp;sublimity.</p>
<h2 id="sniffing">Sniffing</h2>
<p>I borrowed another Windows computer this time, and tried again. This time, I also tried the <span class="caps">HTTP</span> Proxy called Fiddler, which seemed to be able to capture more information, or at least give me more of the information that I would find useful and less of what I wouldn’t find useful. I noticed that for every file which was uploaded, there were in fact three requests, not two as I had previously&nbsp;observed.</p>
<p>So where had this covert <span class="caps">HTTP</span> request been hiding? Behind in the magical realm of HTTPS/TLS encryption. I couldn’t peek into the actual content of the HTTPS requests because of the fact it was encrypted. And as the strings command had revealed earlier, there was a huge block of base64 encoded text which appeared to look like a sort of public key. It suddenly connected, the Music Manager probably has its own list of trusted certificate authorities, and that’s why adding a mere certificate to Windows wouldn’t do a&nbsp;thing.</p>
<p>But the unencrypted <span class="caps">CONNECT</span> request, which initiates a HTTPS connection said&nbsp;enough.</p>
<p>There was a request to android.clients.google.com and it was encoded with gasp: application/x-protobufs. If this was some sort of action movie, here would be the scene where the antagonist from the previous movie reveals that he is still alive (with some facial scarring) and the person responsible for all the disappearing bodies (of&nbsp;data).</p>
<p>I was about to give up at this point, but then a new idea&nbsp;sturck.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-hope">A New&nbsp;Hope</h2>
<p>This is the second movie-title article sub-title that I’m aware of, unless there’s a movie called “Packet Sniffing”. For the prospective filmmaker, this is when the protagonist has the flashback and remembers that time, long long ago (though here it’s only like four days, you can take creative liberties), when refining the art of hackery, a task involved crafting an implementation of a storage system from the web interface of a specific cloud drive&nbsp;service.</p>
<p>So, I noticed that I had spent so much time exploring what enigma lay beyond the surface of Google Music, that I totally forgot to actually use the service. And when I did, I realized that there was an Edit Song Info context button. Trying the feature out, it seems to be a simple <span class="caps">JSON</span> post to a certain modifyentries&nbsp;URL.</p>

Amazing. I just stumbled on the magical code which would allow me to finish the project. Yay. Now I had to figure out what the xt= parameter means (after determining it’s necessity). My first hunch was to search the <span class="caps">HTML</span> source of the page, because the magical access codes for Amazon Cloud Drive were put inside a hidden input element. But no, it wasn’t there. Now the fear starts settling in, what if it’s a strategically computed magical super string? But why would they ever do&nbsp;that?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Somehow I noticed somewhere on every time the page is loaded, the network logs indicate a Set-Cookie: xt=<span class="caps">AM</span>-REDACTED. Now I knew how to get it: Just send an XHR to the cloud player and copy the&nbsp;cookie.</p>
<h2 id="serverid">ServerID</h2>
<p>Now, the important pat of all the items in the entries object is probably the id. Everything else seems somewhat generic, and probably exists for any song that you throw at the service, but id clearly has a definite, important, non-random, predetermined value. I thought that there was no correlation between the data passed from the uploaded data and the id which was here, since the upload_id was way too long and had nothing in common with this song&nbsp;id.</p>
<p>Since the songs that get uploaded have no title, they always appear first on the alphabetical list of songs, so I figured I would just pull a list of the songs, alphabetically, and then take the first one to get the <span class="caps">ID</span>. Then I discovered the auto-playlists, which included one for most recently&nbsp;added.</p>
<p>Unless you have the power of omniscience, you don’t know that the format of the IDs here were like das8f7-adf0w8f-adf87we-mwere, because I slapped a huge <span class="caps">REDACTED</span> on the latter half. The random string generating code that I’ve used for years out of convenience is Math.random().toString(36).substr(2), which basically generates a random float, converts the fractional part to base 36 (0-9 a-z) and strips the leading “0.” from the string. This incidentally ends up being quite short (especially on chrome, it’s much longer on firefox), and lacks the&nbsp;dashes.</p>
<p>So I looked at the <span class="caps">ID</span> for one of the streams and noticed that the id string was unusually short. I started wondering why something like that would happen, and then it struck me, not quite like lightning because I’m still alive (though whether or not I am when you’re reading this is a totally different question). This file ID was the same thing as the ServerID which I thought was just a random useless value that was arbitrarily required for it to work. I deleted the whole getRecent routine and suddenly everything started to make&nbsp;sense.</p>
<h2 id="fish">Fish</h2>
<p>You probably don’t remember my old blog post, almost a year ago, titled A Bright Coloured Fish: Parsing ID3v2 Tags in Javascript and ExtensionFM. Recently, by fate, I happen to have used that code more times that I’m comfortable with, and it seems that once again I must revive this old memory. It’s fairly outdated, and some things are very nasty. Not being able to parse ID3v1 is pretty terrible, though I don’t think I have any songs using&nbsp;v1.</p>
<p>I hoped that Google’s magical server farm would have parsed out the <span class="caps">ID3</span> data, but that doesn’t seem to be the case. I have to manually parse them in the&nbsp;client.</p>
<p>I had to change the id3v2 library a slight bit: the picture parsing code now includes a blob attribute, since the the album art must be uploaded to Google’s servers in order to be included in the&nbsp;metadata.</p>
<p>I guess that fishtank sound was an omen. I’m sure the prospective filmmaker could use it in some way like&nbsp;this.</p>
<h2 id="time">Time</h2>
<p>Rather auspiciously, the modifyentries command included durationMillis. Since it became evident that the music player app had no way of knowing the length of a song without some tag data, that it would be impossible to seek to a certain portion of the song without this ability, it was really important. But since this was from the <span class="caps">API</span> for a user-facing operation, and editing the length of a song isn’t something that a user can or should be able to edit, it was pretty fortunate that that was included as part of the&nbsp;API.</p>
<p>This wasn’t without problems though. It’s not that easy to measure the length of a song. The Length tag of a <span class="caps">MP3</span> file is actually seldom included, so that clearly can’t work. I looked at how to measure the length, and it was pretty scary, since it doesn’t seem like there’s any way other than parsing all the frames out and multiplying the&nbsp;bitrates.</p>
<p>But this time, <span class="caps">HTML5</span> comes to the rescue. I never thought I would be so happy to use . I just take the file, convert it to a blob URL through that nest of if/else statements that handles different versions of chrome. I open it with new Audio and wait for the metadata event, indicating that I now know the length of the song to thirteen places after the decimal. Because of course, I would hate to miss the last picosecond of my&nbsp;song.</p>
<p>I felt sad for the little femtoseconds and attoseconds who were neglected by Google when they decided that the song lengths should be milliseconds. Not quantized divisions of Planck&nbsp;time.</p>
<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>
<p>At this point, nothing interesting really happened. I fixed up the interface, added queueing, and other insignificant things. I published it and spent the rest of day writing a hopelessly long document describing&nbsp;it.</p>
<h2 id="protocol">Protocol</h2>
<p>For those who want to build their own programs which upload to Google Music, I guess I’ll write a summary of how it&nbsp;works.</p>
<ol>
<li>Get Song Metadata (<span class="caps">ID3</span> data, Duration,&nbsp;primarily)</li>
<li>Login to&nbsp;Google</li>
<li><span class="caps">POST</span> to&nbsp;uploadsj.clients.google.com/uploadsj/rupio</li>

            <section class="content"><p><a href="/articles/2009/Ajax%20Animator%20+%20Wave/SadTab.jpg"><img src="/articles/2009/Ajax%20Animator%20+%20Wave/SadTab-150x150.jpg" alt=""></a> sadly it led to&nbsp;this</p>
<p>So I think that the Ajax Animator Wave thingy is almost done. I think it’s really awesome, there’s some new stuff in there that may help in collaboration. There is still a bit of dogfooding left (VectorEditor needs to be updated as while the new version of Raphael is being used which eliminates a lot of the hacks being used, the change in path APIs means that lines, polylines and paths all fail). So after a bit of more bug testing, I think it’s going to be pretty cool. It will definately be out by the time the 100,000 people join Google Wave (I can’t wait!). But I’m not sure if it will be today, next week, or the week after&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>So to show some cool stuff I can do, I’ll publish the first time this blog has ever really seen an animation by me. But here’s the first animation I’ve made (It uses the Wave, center and flip plugins which you can access in the script executor, but someone could easily and tediously do this by hand&nbsp;too):</p>
<p><a href="/articles/2009/Ajax%20Animator%20+%20Wave/Wavey.gif"><img src="/articles/2009/Ajax%20Animator%20+%20Wave/Wavey.gif" alt="Wavey" title="Wavey"></a> Try ignoring the probable trademark&nbsp;infringement.</p>
<p>The cool stuff being used here are first the ability to draw a rectangle, to multi-select, multi-copy, multi-paste and manual repeatition. After that, it’s multi-dragged down, and next frame then, the <code>Ax.plugins\[&quot;center&quot;]()</code> plugin is called which obviously centers all of them (by the Y axis, preserving the X one). Then it goes to the next keyframe and using <code>Ax.plugins[&quot;Sine&quot;](100,0.01)</code> (first arg defines multiplier for y axis and latter defines something I forgot, i think multiplier for the current X axis).  Then the same function but with <code>(100,0.02)</code> and then <code>Ax.plugins.flip()</code> to make it look like the wave logo. Do some multi-select and set the color. After that cool stuff, it gets saved as text and opened in OnlyPaths Ajax Animator (which also demos a really cool feature called forwards-compatibility). It gets saved as a <span class="caps">GIF</span> and uploaded to my blog after&nbsp;that.</p>
