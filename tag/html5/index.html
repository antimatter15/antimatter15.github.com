              Hi. I’m <b>Kevin Kwok</b>, and I’m currently a sophomore at <b>MIT</b>, 
              and this is my obligatory online presence or whatever.  
            </p>
            <p>
              I regularly updated this site from 2007, when I started it in elementary school, 
              to summer 2014, when it was unwittingly absorbed into an international phishing ring.
            </p>
            <p>
              But like a phoenix, hydra or the national deficit, the site is back 
              again bigger than ever (after a rather long gestation period).
            </p>
            <p>
              For more obnoxious autobiographical content 
              blended with bits of nostalgia for the old PHP-on-sketchy-free-webhosting days, click here.

            <section class="content"><p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kchecgcglnoohbdghckmcbefllnibadd?hl=en"><img src="/articles/2011/Offline%20Wiki%20Chrome%20Webstore%20App/Wikipedia-Google-Chrome_019.png" alt="" title="Wikipedia - Google Chrome_019"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kchecgcglnoohbdghckmcbefllnibadd?hl=en">Offline Wiki for Chrome</a> is now on the Web Store. The app that started a <a href="/2011/04/offline-wiki-chrome-webstore-app/2011/02/html5-offline-wikipedia-reader-and-help-me-win-a-cr-48/">few months ago</a> and took forms as <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mplnjjdpheipggojikpifkibnoaakkii">Offline Dictionary</a>. The chrome app version is much more refined, aesthetically and functionally. The search bar and autocomplete are much less obtrusive, and there’s gradients and box shadows, a sure indication of progress&nbsp;:)</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>The most significant difference, is that it includes the<strong> entire English Wikipedia</strong>, a pretty close approximation of the sum of all human knowledge. Uncompressed, it’s something like 30 gigabytes of raw text, and the compressed version that I’ve compiled for this app clocks in at around 3.7 gigabytes (3.<span class="caps">4GB</span> for the actual compressed dump and 0.3 for the search index file). Hosting and serving up all those gigabytes does cost money, so that’s why the app isn’t free. But it’s still a pretty good value considering the equivalent apps for iOS are <a href="http://www.brilliantish.com/allofwiki/">twice</a> <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia-offline-for-ipad/id384022310?mt=8">the</a> <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/encyclopedia/id288141564?mt=8">price</a>.</p>
<p>It includes an index which lists every single article in Wikipedia, paginated and navigable through a scroll bar. There are something like 50,000 pages of the index (the exact number depends on the size of your screen), and articles are divided into columns. There’s a button which sends you to a random article, and a search&nbsp;bar.</p>
<p>However the notion of this app is pretty strange: A webapp which only serves its function when offline. However, the ease of installation and use of this app is somewhat unparalleled on the desktop space. This app allows the <strong>browsing of the database instantly</strong> after the download has begun, rather than nearly all other such apps which require the entire dump to be downloaded first. There’s no conversion process. Everything pretty much hopefully just&nbsp;works.</p>
<h2 id="html5-is-awesome-"><span class="caps">HTML5</span> is&nbsp;awesome.</h2>
<p>The interface is done entirely with <span class="caps">CSS</span> and HTML, no images except the obligatory <a href="http://xkcd.com/214/">xkcd</a> reference. The toolbar is a css3 gradient and enclosed with <span class="caps">HTML5</span> tags like &lt;article&gt;, &lt;header&gt; and &lt;footer&gt;. The download progress is indicated by a native &lt;progress&gt; bar element. The index is navigable through a slider bar created using &lt;input type=range&gt; and all the page titles are put automatically into columns by the css3 column layout&nbsp;properties.</p>
<p>The really cool stuff is what’s in the javascript. Probably the most significant development which has enabled this app is an awesome thing called the FileSystem <span class="caps">API</span> which exposes a special persistent sandboxed read/write directory which can be modified through the File API. When the page is first loaded, the process of downloading begins, and it uses the responseType attribute of the XMLHttpRequest to get the downloaded chunk (it just sets the request header to specify a range of one megabyte) as an array buffer. Array Buffers are a part of the WebGL specification which enables the storage and manipulation of binary data. It then uses BlobBuilder to convert that array buffer into Blob which can then be written using the File API to the hard&nbsp;disk.</p>
<p>To search, it reads a small portion of the index file by using a particular slice of the file, which is the equivalent of seeking on a disk. It implements binary search to quickly locate a certain article on the disk and then reads a chunk from the dump in much the same way. Then it uses a javascript implementation of the <span class="caps">LZMA</span> compression algorithm to decode a certain hundred-kilobyte block into raw WikiText which is then parsed into&nbsp;HTML.</p>
<p>Finally, the pushState and replaceState methods from the History <span class="caps">API</span> are used to handle the navigation of pages without&nbsp;reloading,.</p>

<p>This is my take at an <span class="caps">MP3</span> player. I would consider this one of my better designs (I’m no designer or artist, and that sort of shows). It’s fairly minimalistic, a product both of my design and the fact it was created a few hours. But this isn’t about design. No, it’s a<strong> music player </strong>that operates<strong> entirely in your browser</strong> with files stored on <strong>your hard drive</strong>.</p>
<p>Here’s basically how it works. There’s an &lt;input type=file webkitdirectory&gt; so you can go and select your music folder. It gets a list of all files, reads the first 128 kilobytes of each mp3 file and parses it for <span class="caps">ID3</span> tags, constructs a library and makes it&nbsp;searchable.</p>
<p>The interface is composed of four main items: a huge search bar, the music library, a playlist and the audio controls. It’s pretty self&nbsp;explanatory.</p>
<p>Here it is: <a href="http://antimatter15.github.com/player/player.html">http://antimatter15.github.com/player/player.html</a></p>
<p>It should work on Chrome, it might work on Safari, and will partially work on Firefox 4 (No directory select, no <span class="caps">MP3</span>). Definitely won’t work on IE9 and probably won’t work on&nbsp;Opera.</p>

            <section class="content"><p><a href="http://www.lucidchart.com/community/examples/view/4d40ad1f-f1b0-44a7-b39b-1db00ac17bf0"><img src="/articles/2011/HTML5%20Offline%20Wikipedia%20Reader%20and%20Help%20me%20win%20a%20Cr-48/690-11.png" alt="" title="690 (1)"></a></p>
<p>So, lets begin with a plead for you to <a href="http://www.lucidchart.com/community/examples/view/4d40ad1f-f1b0-44a7-b39b-1db00ac17bf0">rate my submission (ideally favorably)</a> for the LucidChart chrome notebook contest, partly because it would be awesome, and I need to test the aforementioned <span class="caps">HTML5</span> offline Wikipedia dump&nbsp;reader.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is awesome, and on my service-less iPhone 2G, one of the most useful apps is one with an outdated (by something like three years) Wikipedia dump reader. There’s something very <a href="http://xkcd.com/548/">much like the Hitchhiker’s Guide </a>in carrying the “sum of all human knowledge” in one’s pocket. Wikipedia grows really quickly and the English language dump (as of last month at time of writing) is over six gigs of bzipped&nbsp;<span class="caps">XML</span>.</p>
<p>Another reason for building an offline Wikipedia dump reader is simply that I can. There’s a lot of cool and cutting edge stuff in this. It uses the file input <span class="caps">JS</span> API, FileReader, Blobs, WebWorkers, fast Javascript to handle a pure-JS implementation of the LZMA compression algorithm, and the FileSystem&nbsp;API.</p>
<p><a href="/articles/2011/HTML5%20Offline%20Wikipedia%20Reader%20and%20Help%20me%20win%20a%20Cr-48/Internet-Google-Chrome_002.png"><img src="/articles/2011/HTML5%20Offline%20Wikipedia%20Reader%20and%20Help%20me%20win%20a%20Cr-48/Internet-Google-Chrome_002.png" alt="" title="Internet - Google Chrome_002"></a></p>
<p>All this stuff has only been possible for a very short amount of time. In fact, the FileSystem <span class="caps">API</span> only arrived with the release of Chrome 9 today. It’s pretty awesome to imagine that a web page, HTML and Javascript is processing multiple gigabytes of data at real time. At the current unoptimized state, the search results and the article shows up instantly within 100ms of a key press event (However, I admit it has yet to be tested on the actual English&nbsp;Wikipedia).</p>
<p>This app is almost ideally suited for Chrome <span class="caps">OS</span>. A hundred megabytes worth of data in a month (with the Verizon deal, not to mention that it’s limited to two years) isn’t very much and it would be a pity for the sixteen gigabytes of SSD space on a Cr-48 to be wasted. One of the dumps that I’ve compiled is a subset of the English Wiktionary which makes a great lightweight (8MB) dictionary with over sixty five thousand words. Wiktionary is fairly large at 217MB, and the Simple English Wikipedia is 51MB.
<a href="/articles/2011/HTML5%20Offline%20Wikipedia%20Reader%20and%20Help%20me%20win%20a%20Cr-48/interned-Google-Chrome_004.png"><img src="/articles/2011/HTML5%20Offline%20Wikipedia%20Reader%20and%20Help%20me%20win%20a%20Cr-48/interned-Google-Chrome_004.png" alt="" title="interned - Google Chrome_004"></a>
Assuming you can somehow access the dumps, I probably won’t post them on this server because of the massive bandwidth usage, someone else could, the process for using it is very simple. Download the file to your  computer through <span class="caps">HTTP</span>, a torrent, or create it yourself. You might have noticed that the favicon is a picture of a carrot because that’s the current codename. Well, not really a codename, but I was scrolling through some icon lists and saw one for a carrot on the first page. I don’t even like carrots, but I digress. The dump uploading screen has a picture of a bunny biting a file upload carrot that you click on to select the file. Select the file, and it automagically copies it over to a persistent folder. Then you’re off to searching and reading articles and definitions&nbsp;:)</p>
<p>I’m not done yet, or at least, I don’t feel like packaging it up and submitting it to the chrome webstore yet because I need to figure out a good way to host database&nbsp;dumps.</p>

<p>drag2up was a <a href="/2010/12/drag2up-2-0-drag-and-drop-uploading-for-all-sites/2010/10/drag2up-drag-files-onto-any-site/">browser extension I built a few months ago</a>, and recently bumped it up to 2.0. The basic idea is to use <span class="caps">HTML5</span> File API and the drag/drop integration that <strong>Chrome and Firefox</strong> implements to enable uploads to any website by<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBqxmO-ZrDY"> simply dragging and dropping</a> the file from your computer onto the respective site. Instead of the trouble of opening a new tab, navigating to your favorite file provider, waiting for it to load, pressing the browse button, navigating to the folder with your image, pressing “Open”, then hitting the submit button, waiting for the upload to finish, copy the link, find the original tab among the mess of tabs that fills your tab bar and finally scrolling down, selecting the box and pasting the <span class="caps">URL</span>. All to share a three megabyte file. drag2up streamlines the process into a single, swift gesture where you drag the file onto the text entry field. The link is instantly added while the file is being <strong>uploaded in the background</strong>. If someone navigates to the link before it’s done uploading, the page uses the Google App Engine Channel <span class="caps">API</span> to stream <strong>real time</strong> upload&nbsp;status.</p>
<p>It still has a pretty simple user interface that works with <strong>zero initial setup</strong>. In addition to using gist and imgur for text files and image uploading respectively, it includes many additional services, configurable through a simple drag and drop interface. The new version also sports Firefox&nbsp;support.</p>

<p><strong>Technical&nbsp;Information</strong></p>
<p>There’s some pretty cool stuff going on in the new release. This release is really close to the bleeding edge of what’s capable on the web and with browsers. On Chrome, to upload files, the multipart/form-data xhr is being pieced together with array buffers and typed arrays, stuff from the <strong>WebGL</strong> specification. The Firefox version is based on the latest beta release of <strong>Mozilla Jetpack</strong> (hacked slightly so that the resulting xpi works with 3.6 as well as 4.0). Transferring data between the background page and the individual content scripts (or pageMods in Jetpack’s terms) is done with the createBlobURL (also called createObjectURL) function and binary XMLHttpRequest. On older versions of Firefox, FileReader is used to load files into base64 encoded data urls. Inter-frame communication is done with postMessage and native <span class="caps">JSON</span> serialization and parsing functions.  Picasa and Dropbox support are built on Javascript implementations of OAuth (based on <a href="https://github.com/bslatkin/clip-it-good">Clip It Good</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kenotron/chromepad">Chromepad</a>). So, yeah, there’s lots of new and super cool stuff in&nbsp;there.</p>
<p>The content script was more or less rewritten in order to support Gmail, which led to some interesting design changes. Firstly, the new version establishes a sort of hierarchy, a difference between a root frame and the most subordinated one. Each drag event is sent to the top using postMessage, where the root frame decides whether or not to render the targets or to remove them. Once the decision is made, it <a href="https://github.com/antimatter15/drag2up/blob/master/data/drag2up.js#L108">trickles downward</a> to each of it’s immediate frames and then trickles back down to each subordinate frame. Whenever a frame is created, a loop detects that one has been added and attempts to access it’s <span class="caps">DOM</span> in order to insert a script element that initializes the code. Interestingly, content scripts (in chrome) are unable to access the child frames so a script needs to be inserted into the immediate page in order to insert a script into a child page. The scripts also set document.__drag2up to ensure there aren’t any frames that load themselves twice (interestingly creating an event and dispatching it seeing if there’s a event listener that does preventDefault isn’t a reliable indicator. I wanted to ideally create a system that was mostly undetectable by the parent page, but eventually settled for this simpler and more reliable&nbsp;implementation).</p>
<p>Once the “trickle_reactivate” message (every message happens to be eighteen characters, because  of certain really weird design ideas) is recieved by all the frames, they loop through all the elements on the page, searching for elements that meet the isDroppable criteria. It does not trigger on elements who have a width*height &lt; 100, so no really tiny boxes. It needs to be an input element type text or textarea that isn’t read only or disabled, or it needs to be an element whose contents are editable. Then it checks the positioning of the element using the document.elementFromPoint function twice (one accounting for scrolling and one that doesn’t to differentiate fixed positioning from others). The drop target is a div with a massive style attribute. It has rounded corners, css transitions and is positioned either absolutely or fixed based on the positioning of the associated input element. It’s centered around the element or completely covers it for smaller areas. When the user hovers over it, the opacity changes (the behavior is actually reversed from the last version). The original version faded out slightly when hovered over, which, after some thought, I realized made no sense. Similar to the drop target is a purple settings box on the lower right corner. I’m actually quite displeased with it. It’s not a great user experience, but at least it’s noticable. Primarily, it was added because I have no idea how to get the Preferences button to work with Jetpack and Google manages to bury the Options button somewhere deep within the depths of Chrome’s single&nbsp;menu.</p>
<p>Once the file is dropped, the content script decides whether it was a file that was dropped or an image that was dropped from some other page. If it’s an image (because that’s the simpler case to deal with), it does something that’s actually slightly counterintuitive. Using getData(‘text/uri-list’) isn’t reliable as in many cases, the image is wrapped in a link tag and that only gives the link <span class="caps">URL</span> instead of that image. So instead, it reads text/html and inserts it into a temporary div and pulls out the source attribute which is then sent to the background page. If the thing that was dropped is a file, first, it checks if the browser supports one of the Blob URI creation methods and if that’s available, it uses that to create a URL. If not, the file is read using FileReader as a base64 encoded data url and sent to the background page. But not immediately, because often the script is running in an unprivledged environment, so it does a postMessage to the topmost parent which should be privileged. The privileged content script sends the message to the even more privileged background page that initiates the actual uploading&nbsp;process.</p>
<p>Before going into what the background page actually does, there’s the settings page. I’m actually pretty proud of how it turned out. With the large number of hosts that are supported, I needed a way for the user to select hosts for different types of files. I could have used select boxes, but they’re not generally great when dealing with image based concepts, because a company’s logo is often more recognizable than the name (odd that I’m saying that, seeing as this blog has neither a distinctive name nor even a favicon). So instead, I built this little grid where the user can drag hosts into boxes on the right. It’s made with jQuery <span class="caps">UI</span>, because I don’t particularly like the API’s provided in&nbsp;HTML5.</p>
<p>The background page handles the uploading. Basically, there’s a bunch of javascript files that are loaded into it. The hardest part was by far, OAuth. If anything, this project has only refined my dislike of OAuth. And because this post is already insanely long, I’ll go and rant about the problems of OAuth anyway. There’s already<a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/guides/2010/09/twitter-a-case-study-on-how-to-do-oauth-wrong.ars"> a great article on how terrible of an idea</a> it is for OAuth to be used in any application that runs code on the client. But Photobucket, Picasa and Dropbox still don’t understand that (or don’t care) and only provide OAuth. But that’s not really a problem, I just hate OAuth because even though It’s a standard, each service provider has some little quirks that take hours to debug and ends up being extremely frustrating. Maybe the OAuth gods are angry with me or something, but it’s incredibly&nbsp;troublesome.</p>

I never bothered debugging Opera, I figured it was another huge issue that would demand a rewrite (as supporting Firefox had needed, because the order of the object keys isn’t preserved and breaks the <span class="caps">EBML</span> result, or at least for Firefox’s parser which seems to be somewhat stricter than Chrome’s, is that ffmpeg?). And after premature optimization (stripping “unnecessary” EBML tags), my code didn’t work in chrome, so I had to revert to an earlier revision. All my testing code was based on file drag-drop stuff, and Opera doesn’t support that. Until I saw this <a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=9991409#p9991409">mozillazine topic</a>, I didn’t care, but it was a lot easier to fix than I&nbsp;feared.</p>
<p>Part of the solution was getting rid of the canvas stage. Admittedly, the canvas stage was pretty useless once the toDataURL() stage was removed before the first public release, but I didn’t feel like deleting code, so it stayed there. Also, I noticed that the global variable that gets introduced was accidentally named “WebM”, which is wrong, it should be “WebP”, but because of the uncreative format naming and similarities, I didn’t notice. Not sure, but it seems to be more stable&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>Chrome probably will add WebP soon, and it needs to be future proof, detecting whether or not a browser supports the WebP format. To do that, it creates an Image, sets the src to a data url of a 4x4 webp image and listens to the onload and onerror events, checking if the size is correct and there were no errors loading it. The routine is expected to error and totally untested as there aren’t any browsers that support the feature yet for me to&nbsp;try.</p>
<p>Another change, is that by default, it will automatically load all the same-origin (because of the limitations of <span class="caps">XHR</span>) webp images (from &lt;img&gt; tags), on the DOMContentLoaded event, so the library is practically drop-in now. In any web page, you can pretty much add &lt;script src=”<a href="http://antimatter15.github.com/weppy/weppy.js">http://antimatter15.github.com/weppy/weppy.js</a>“&gt;&lt;/script&gt; and on the supported browsers, it should automatically load and replace all WebP images, though not something I would really&nbsp;recommended.</p>
<p>The demo is the same place it always was: <a href="http://antimatter15.github.com/weppy/demo.html">http://antimatter15.github.com/weppy/demo.html</a></p>
<p>There is also this nifty hack that uses &lt;canvas&gt; to add an alpha channel to the WebP image (adapted from the <a href="http://blog.jackadam.net/2010/alpha-jpegs/">original <span class="caps">JPEG</span></a> one): <a href="http://antimatter15.github.com/weppy/alpha/alpha.html">http://antimatter15.github.com/weppy/alpha/alpha.html</a></p>

<p>Drag2Up, is an app named horribly, as I suck at naming things. It’s very simple in terms of capabilities - no buttons, no interface, which is pretty much the ideal type of user experience, something that’s intuitive and lends focus to content, not chrome. Really, this post isn’t useful in any way. What you should do, is <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/bjgjolhpdlgebodaapdafhdnikagbfll">install it</a> and try it out for yourself (Chrome only, It would be possible to make a firefox version, but I have no experience with Firefox extensions, and the new Jetpack isn’t quite out yet, though you can probably adapt the code relatively easily. Maybe a greasemonkey script by using GM_XHR). <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/bjgjolhpdlgebodaapdafhdnikagbfll">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/bjgjolhpdlgebodaapdafhdnikagbfll</a></p>
<p>Drag and drop is probably one of the greatest forms of interaction ever, it’s intuitive and exemplifies the usefulness of a <span class="caps">GUI</span>. Recently, browsers have implemented drag and drop APIs (actually a <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2009/09/the_html5_drag.html">feature of <span class="caps">IE5</span>.5+ </a>but then codified into part of <span class="caps">HTML5</span>). Some browsers, namely Chrome and Firefox implement a dataTransfer property of the drop events that allow one to access files dragged from the user’s desktop (or file browser) onto a web application. The application can read the file through the File API, and do whatever it chooses. Probably most notably is Gmail’s utilization of the feature that allows dragging and dropping files from the desktop onto a message to upload it as an attachment. When it was announced, some people remarked how excited everyone was of a feature that was present in desktop clients for several decades&nbsp;already.</p>

<p>Browser vendors have the role of enabling developers to do cool stuff. It’s up to a web developer or service to maintain an application, to update it and add new features. Undoubtedly, many do, living on the bleeding edge of innovation, but most don’t, and stay locked in a certain state for years if not longer. Extension developers have no obligation to be entirely objective in terms of how it deals with websites, and many are site-specific, adding features to sites that lack them, integrated into the interface, utilizing product-specific APIs, or document structure. Browser vendors enable innovation, site developers integrate standards and browser extensions add features to sites, because the developer is unwilling or because of restrictions on the functionality of web apps (x-domain, persistence,&nbsp;etc).</p>
<p>Uploading images is a fairly common task, and the standard go-to-file-host-site, click-the-attach-button, browse-button-hitting, navigation-through-folders and waiting-for-page-to-reload-after-uploading, link-copying, tab-switching and pasting. Some applications like <a href="http://www.getcloudapp.com/">CloudApp</a> look promising in alleviating this needlessly tedious process, but only reduce the interaction steps a little. The ideal would be making that third-party file upload service integrate seamlessly into all web applications, with a level of integration akin to Gmail, drag and&nbsp;drop.</p>
<p>As awesome as it sounds, it’s not as easy to implement as one might like. The basic idea was to detect when a drag event started, and to iterate all the elements, adding an absolutely positioned, semitransparent mask to indicate that it’s a drop target. A few issues occur with that, I have <a href="/2010/10/drag2up-drag-files-onto-any-site/2010/10/gmail-style-html5-dragdrop/">a little writeup on those issues</a>.</p>
<p>A lot of <span class="caps">WYSIWYG</span> editors use iframes, and creating content scripts with all_frames: true doesn’t necessarily mean it runs on all frames (for some very odd reason). And also for some reason, there’s no way to access frames from window.frames in content scripts. So I have this hack where if there are frames, it injects some javascript into the real page executed in the page’s context to run it within the iframe (if it’s the same domain, as it always is in wysiwyg editors). Then events get propagated from the sub-frame into the parent window, through postMessage that is subsequently handled by the content script, forwarded to a background page using chrome.extensions.sendRequest, and it all happens in reverse once the server gives a response. As such, it’s a really bad idea to use this for large files since it needs to be passed around several times over several pages, and apparently <a href="http://blog.andrewvc.com/node-js-and-binary-data">V8 isn’t the best with big strings</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from that, uploading to imgur for some odd reason takes a long time. I don’t like sites that don’t have simple <span class="caps">JSON</span> POST APIs, and there really aren’t many that fit that criterion. So with the initial release, images are uploaded with imgur and text files are all uploaded to a github&nbsp;gist.</p>

<p>I’m making a (really awesome) chrome extension that involves dragging and dropping files. <span class="caps">MDC</span>, as <a href="http://promotejs.com/">usual</a>, has great <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DragDrop/DataTransfer">information</a> on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/using_files_from_web_applications">topic</a>. Gmail does it almost perfectly, with the green file drop target. But all other implementations of this feature suffer from two issues, and Gmail’s code is far too obfuscated for any mere mortal to interpret (no doubt thanks to closure). When implementing the file drop target, two fairly important user experience issues occur. I don’t know what way Gmail does it, and I just used whatever solution&nbsp;worked.</p>
<p>Firstly, is that you only want to trigger the drop target once a file is being dragged onto the web app. You don’t want a file drop target to appear once someone starts dragging text (fairly simple, check that e.dataTransfer.types includes File). Even trickier (even Gmail doesn’t get this right) is dragging links also triggers the file drop target for some reason (it’s tricky because then e.dataTransfer.types also includes the File type for some odd reason). There’s no way to access file data as it’s being dragged (getData always returns undefined). One thing that I still have no idea about is inter-browser-window data&nbsp;transfers.</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/606882.js"> </script>

<p>Secondly, is how to get the dialog to dismiss itself once the dragged image is dragged out of the viewport. It’s pretty tricky because of how the events bubble and don’t always go through &lt;body&gt;. The solution I eventually arrived at was to add a timer on the dragleave and see if within fifty milliseconds (a random amount of time, zero works too, but fifty feels safer), another drag event is&nbsp;fired.</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/606885.js"> </script>

<p>Hopefully, people will find this useful&nbsp;:)</p>

<p><a href="http://antimatter15.com/misc/gravity2.html">Here’s my foray into the flash-esque html5 game arena</a>. It’s a simple game built initially in &lt;canvas&gt; but later scrapped for Raphael because I guess it’s something more suitable for svg than canvas. The interface is fairly simple, you <strong>click to start the game</strong>, where your projectile is sent off at the velocity relative to green blob in the center. Once it’s launched, the projectile is affected by the gravitational field of all the planets in some fairly pretty near-orbits. Once the projectile is in motion, <strong>clicking drops a new planet</strong> at where your cursor is, <strong>holding down makes the planet grow</strong>. The objective is to have the projectile not accelerate off the&nbsp;screen.</p>
<p>As per <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler">Kepler’s laws</a>, getting near a planet produces the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist">“gravitational slingshot”</a> effect. Since the projectile tends to fly toward the center of planets, a magical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_by_zero">divide-by-zero</a> causes the infinite acceleration toward&nbsp;doom.</p>
<p>As with several other of my  recent projects, it supports various configuration options via the url query string. If you don’t know how it works, basically, you append ?opt1=val1&amp;opt2… to the url. Example: <a href="http://antimatter15.com/misc/gravity2.html?grav=4">gravity2.html?grav=4</a> , simply <a href="http://antimatter15.com/misc/gravity2.html?fastest">gravity2.html?fastest</a> or a combo of <a href="http://antimatter15.com/misc/gravity2.html?fastest&amp;grav=4&amp;random">gravity2.html?fastest&amp;grav=4&amp;random</a>. The current options are <em>fastest</em> to prevent the targeting of 80fps (accepts no args), <em>target</em> the target fps (obviously can not be used with fastest, in the case, <em>fastest</em> takes precedence) and it accepts one numerical argument, the default is 80. <em>grav</em> accepts one numerical argument, the default is 4 and is the attraction of the planets (<a href="http://antimatter15.com/misc/gravity2.html?grav=0">zero isn’t very fun</a>). _random _makes the planets start off in random places rather than the predefined magical&nbsp;positioning.</p>
<p>Feel free to post highscores in the&nbsp;comments.</p>
