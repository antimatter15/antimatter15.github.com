              Hi. I’m <b>Kevin Kwok</b>, and I’m currently a sophomore at <b>MIT</b>, 
              and this is my obligatory online presence or whatever.  
            </p>
            <p>
              I regularly updated this site from 2007, when I started it in elementary school, 
              to summer 2014, when it was unwittingly absorbed into an international phishing ring.
            </p>
            <p>
              But like a phoenix, hydra or the national deficit, the site is back 
              again bigger than ever (after a rather long gestation period).
            </p>
            <p>
              For more obnoxious autobiographical content 
              blended with bits of nostalgia for the old PHP-on-sketchy-free-webhosting days, click here.

<p>This is my submission to blogdom’s burgeoning class of eternally “work in progress” sites. I’ve been working on this blog reboot for nearly a year at this point (rest assured, I haven’t worked on it for any appreciable fraction of that time— but it’s nonetheless traumatizing for me as “blog posts written” is my primary metric for personal&nbsp;productivity). </p>
<p>There’s still a lot left to be done, but right now it should be in a more or less functional and navigable state. I’ve just added image thumbnailing (so this homepage shouldn’t take a triassic aeon to load anymore), which seems like an addition substantial-enough to warrant some new words adorning the featured post&nbsp;callout.</p>
<p>Most importantly though, it’s now a hip static site hosted on Github Pages (though I might move to S3), so the Turkish phishers last remaining venue for hijacking this site may be sending a pull&nbsp;request. </p>

<h3 id="getting-hacked">Getting&nbsp;Hacked</h3>
<p><a href="/2014/06/blog-hacked/"><div class="pic md right" style="width: 300px" ><img src="/articles/2015/Blog%20Reboot/paypal.png" alt="" ><div class="caption">I unwittingly invited some consultants work on the new blog design, but all they could come up with was clearly somewhat unoriginal&#8230;</div></div></a></p>
<p>I don’t generally pay a lot of attention to this blog— especially during the beginning of every month. I used to generally hold myself to a rule that I would post something new at least once a month, but that policy kept slipping and then there was a mad dash to finish some blog post the first or second day of each new month to be retroactively&nbsp;timestamped. </p>
<p>Anyway, point is that I didn’t notice when the site got hacked for a few days. Unfortunately I don’t have any screenshots of what the site looked like when it was hacked. And at this point I can’t promise you that my mental model of what it looked like is anything more than a&nbsp;hallucination. </p>
<p>It’s a bit of an interesting chapter in my blog’s history, so I’ve spun off this section <a href="/2014/06/blog-hacked/">into its own post</a>.</p>
<h3 id="first-sketches">First&nbsp;Sketches</h3>
<p><div class="pic md right" style="width: 200px" ><img src="/articles/2015/Blog%20Reboot/firstsketch.png" alt="" ></div></p>
<p>I guess it makes a reasonable amount of sense to write about how this site works. This is the first incarnation of the blog which is to any appreciable extent aesthetically original. It isn’t the default theme of JupiterCMS, PHPFusion, nor is it a free template for&nbsp;Wordpress. </p>
<p>It’s a pretty simple design, and it’s pretty nifty that in this day and age, a design which is sparse by ignorance is indestinguishable from a good design which is sparse by (uh) design. There isn’t much besides the simple arrangement of rectangles and lines and it relies pretty heavily on typography and whitespace to delimit&nbsp;sections. </p>
<p>At around the same time my blog stopped working, I came into the posession of a Moleskine. On June 14th, apparently, I started my first sketch of what my blog might be&nbsp;like. </p>
<p><div class="pic md right" style="width: 200px" ><img src="/articles/2015/Blog%20Reboot/ideas.png" alt="" ></div></p>
<p>In retrospect, it didn’t really look very coherent and I have literally no idea what I was trying to do at the time. But one of the motivations behind the entire endeavor was to strike a sort of balance between a blog and a portfolio. I like the idea of documenting the process of things and writing some part of the though process a somewhat non-abbreviated form. But one thing that I noticed is that a blog is a terrible means of surfacing older content, and I think a lot of the interesting ideas I’ve explored are the ones which I played around with several years&nbsp;ago. </p>
<p>On the other spectrum, I didn’t want to go too far in the direction of summary. I didn’t quite want it to be simply a résumé where I condense every endeavor into two buzzword-packed sentences which summarize the little iota of cleverness imbued in the&nbsp;project. </p>
<p>And so the motivation of the design was finding some way to hybridize the two goals— summary and&nbsp;process. </p>
<p>I found another sketch in my Moleskine dated June 24th, which seems to be a bit more coherent. On the right you can see some blocks and lines which, while not having much bearing on the current site design, at least seem like they might pass a Turing test criterion for sufficiently-websiteish&nbsp;website.</p>
<p>One thing that I noticed is that the sequence of my projects tends to be pretty structured. Over the years, I tend to explore little ideas which tend to culminate into singular projects— or alternatively, I build a larger project and spin off smaller components. All of this tends to happen over a relatively short time period (a few months to a&nbsp;year). </p>
<p>So in terms of a projects list, this means that I can introduce a bit of an aesthetic cadence where a series of minor projects are occasionally punctuated by larger projects. And because of this natural faux-hierarchy there’s a natural clustering which is generally both temporal and subjective. The short projects have single-sentence summaries, whereas the larger projects can have a paragraph worth of&nbsp;elaboration.</p>
<p>Naturally, all the project descriptions are hyperlinked and lead to a project page which includes all the blog posts documenting the process of creating that particular&nbsp;project. </p>
<h3 id="new-tools">New&nbsp;Tools</h3>
<p>At some point I helped design a mobile app and ended up getting reasonably familiar with Adobe&nbsp;Illustrator. </p>
<p>It was also at this time that I started using tools that designers use— things like <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html">Adobe Illustrator</a> and <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Bohemian Coding’s Sketch</a>. </p>

<p>Well, so my blog got hacked. Even more unfortunate is that I can’t seem to locate any trace of what it looked like when it was hacked. I guess that’s the problem when you write a post-mortem literally a year after the original&nbsp;incident. </p>
<p>All that’s left is some eerie hints that something&nbsp;happened.</p>
<p>My blog was averaging around <span class="caps">350MB</span> of bandwidth per day, when suddenly on June 6th, it started to spike. In fact, between June 6th and 7th, it used a total of over 40GB of bandwidth. It had eaten through my entire monthly bandwidth&nbsp;quota. </p>
<p><div class="pic md" style="" ><img src="/articles/2014/Getting%20Hacked/table.png" alt="" ></div></p>
<p>At 6:48pm on June 7th, I had discovered that something was going on with my blog and started the process of fixing it. I looked through some of the access logs and saw a particular abundance of a strange file <code>pffam.php</code></p>

</code></pre><p>Presumably <code>pffam.php</code> was the bit of malicious code which was injected onto my server, acting as a nice endpoint for recieving and executing particular actions. It seems that <a href="http://www.indyproject.org/index.en.aspx">Indy Library</a> is some sort of .<span class="caps">NET</span> library which implements&nbsp;HTTP. </p>
<p>It’s interesting that the endpoint is being hit by multiple <span class="caps">IP</span> addresses, and they all seem to geolocate to Eastern European countries. Presumably they’ve built some sort of graphical Command <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Control panel out of Visual Basic or&nbsp;something. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, it looks like I replaced the entire wordpress installation with an older backup— so I don’t actually have any copies of <code>pffam.php</code>. But it managed to use <span class="caps">40GB</span> of bandwidth, and hackers are hardly keen on keeping all their eggs in one bucket, so surely there must have been other endpoints—&nbsp;right?</p>
<p>Sure enough, there’s another&nbsp;endpoint:</p>

</code></pre><p>When <span class="caps">PHP</span>’s built-in assert function is passed a string <code>$assertion</code>, it evaluates that string. It’s less known than <code>eval</code> so this is plausibly useful for evading firewalls of a certain sort. So what it finally translates to&nbsp;is:</p>
<pre><code><span style='display:none' detected-language='bash'></span>assert(<span class="hljs-string">"eval('eval(gzinflate(base64_decode(<span class="hljs-variable">$v</span>)));');"</span>)

<p>This one is also 1500 lines, so I’ve posted it in another <a href="https://gist.github.com/antimatter15/a2375e36f0f04dc6b3fb">Gist</a>. This one looks aesthetically a bit nicer— if it’s not too weird to complement the tools of the people who hacked your&nbsp;website. </p>
<p><div class="pic md" style="" ><img src="/articles/2014/Getting%20Hacked/xstyles.png" alt="WebShell" ></div></p>
<hr>
<p>There’s one (hah, pun not intended) folder entitled <code>1/</code> which is particularly interesting. It has three subdirectories: <code>configweb</code>, <code>sym</code>, and <code>tumdizin</code>.</p>
<p>Configweb seems to be a directory filled with symlinks to 9414 distinct configuration files, each of them residing on someone else’s home directory. It encompasses lots of different software packages including Joomla, Wordpress, Zencart, <span class="caps">SMF</span>, WHM, OSCommerce, VBulletin and&nbsp;ore. </p>
<p>The directory <code>sym</code> seems to just contain a symlink entitled <code>root</code> to— you guessed it— <code>/</code>. </p>
<p>And finally <code>tumdizin</code> seems to link to the web roots of 116 distinct shared hosting accounts which happen to reside on the same&nbsp;server.</p>
<hr>
<p>There’s also that folders which blow up in the tree <code>x4MslaR1CW</code>, and <code>ptRiJiayze</code>. You can probably guess by files like <code>logo_paypal_106x29.png</code> that this site got turned essentially into a phishing website for Paypal.

<p>However, it seems that there was some weird activity going on starting a few days before the massive traffic. There’s an <code>error_log</code> file which seems to grow pretty slowly in general.

<p>I ended up downloading a daily backup of the server which was taken before it was hacked (June 1, 2014) and installing it onto a small virtual machine. I downloaded a Wordpress plugin for exporting the entire website as static <span class="caps">HTML</span> pages and uploaded it to Github pages. This served as a stop-gap measure for almost an entire year while I was getting the new site to&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>This experience is largely why I decided that this new incarnation would be a static site— essentially free from the perils that come with a dynamic website. It’s not like the old version used dynamic content to much advantage anyway, it was cached enough that it was practically static&nbsp;anyway. </p>

<p><em>Work expands so as to fill the time available for its&nbsp;completion.</em></p>
<p>— Parkinson’s&nbsp;Law</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the past four or so months, I’ve been working on just one major project. It’s rather depressing to think that I built a reasonably impressive initial prototype over the course of about a dozen sleep-deprived hours, and that all I’ve accomplished since then is minor polish. Technically, there have been at least two rewrites, completely new capabilities and substantially improved technology, but none of that really matters when it comes to describing the project. A project is what it is, at 80% completion, at 95% and&nbsp;99%.</p>
<p>Second semester at school has started, and that means that Pass/No Record isn’t a thing anymore, and everyone else is adjusting their behavior appropriately. Problem is, <em>I</em> haven’t changed. It turns out that an entire semester of racing toward the bottom is unsustainable when suddenly the floor has been adjusted to above your current position. But the more important point is that it’s leaving less time, and in particular, less contiguous time to work on&nbsp;anything.</p>
<p>Last month, I was working on a port of the Telea inpainting algorithm. Inpainting refers to any kind of image processing operation which attempts to intelligently fill in certain regions of an image with other content. Perhaps the most famous implementation of this is Photoshop’s Content Aware Fill feature, which uses a texture-synthesis and patch-based system, which enables them to copy over things like patterns, and textures, filling in vast contiguous regions of missing content. The problem is patch-based inpainting is almost always quite slow, in spite of its high quality results. There are simpler algorithms based on the Fast Marching Method like Telea or Navier-Stokes which use diffusion models and the ilk in order to propagate the solid colors of the bordering region of some inpainting mask inwards. I’ll write an actual blog post about this once I package it up and build a nifty demo for&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Last year, Ben Kamens of Khan Academy posted about reverse engineering the flyout menu in Amazon, which suffered from the rather odd behavior of <em>acting exactly how it should</em>. You totally should be able to navigate to a submenu without worrying about accidentally mousing over something else. I looked around for a context menu library which could actually do this, but for some reason I couldn’t find one, so I decided to make my&nbsp;own.</p>

<p>If the frequency of these progress reports is to say anything, it’s that I’m terrible at sticking to a schedule and even worse at estimating progress. I was hoping that I’d be able to use the Thanksgiving break in order to be productive and get ahead of my various projects– in particular, getting the text-detection and <span class="caps">OCR</span> extension to a state complete enough to&nbsp;publish.</p>
<p>For the past few days I’ve been playing with writing a minimal cryptocurrency which incorporates the central innovation of Bitcoin— the hashcash based transaction chain. It’s a simple enough concept that I could manage to implement the core functionality in about a hundred lines of&nbsp;Coffeescript.</p>
<p>I’m also working on a cute little alarm clock which incorporates a pressure sensor underneath my bed in lieu of a snooze button. The goal is to use it as a framework for novel approaches to the tried and true problem of getting undergrads to wake up at ungodly hours (anything before noon). It’s powered by an Arduino and <span class="caps">I2C</span> ChronoDot and a large 7-segment&nbsp;display.</p>
<p>I’ve laid a little ethernet cable from the side of my bed, along the ceiling and to the door which contains a bunch of little <span class="caps">EL</span> wire inverter boxes (I’m smothering the transformers with Sugru in order to hopefully dampen the onset of my acoustically-induced&nbsp;insanity).</p>

              <h2><a href="/2013/10/october-progress-update/">October Progress Update</a> <span class="subtitle">31 October 2013</span></h2>
            </header>
            <section class="content"><p>It’s Halloween, and I still haven’t posted a monthly blog post and I don’t quite feel like retroactively posting something next month. I’m understandably quite starved for free time with my attempts to reconcile sleep with college with social interaction- and from the looks of it, I probably won’t be able to publish the blog post that I’ve been working on for the better half of this month before it the month&nbsp;ends.</p>
<p>For the past five days, I’ve started using an actual laptop- a late-2013 Macbook Pro Retina 15” (yes, I made it through the better part of two months of college without a laptop more sophisticated than a 2009-era Chromebook). Aside from the obligatory setup process and acclimation to the new operating system, and a mild bout of screen-size-anorexia (which with proper counseling, I’ve more or less recovered from- the 13” is actually somewhat small, but I still can’t quite shake the feeling that 15” is a smidgen too big), the process has been quite&nbsp;painless.</p>
<p>Getting a laptop slightly more capable than the Series 5 Chromebook (not the beefier Celeron model, the original Atom) is a quite long overdue change. I participated in my first hackathon (incidentally also the first time I’ve really written code since the start of the school year) during the beginning of the month. By the end of that 32-hour stretch, I did yearn for a functional trackpad, larger screen and more performant setup. But my shining knight in Unibody Aluminium armor would not have come until three weeks later. But I don’t think the productivity gains would have affected things too much- even with this dinky setup, the prototype scored the second place&nbsp;trophy.</p>
<p>The exact subject of the project was actually discussed briefly in the last progress update, on that long list of projects which I’ve yet to start. That night, I had actually taken the initiative to do a proper port of some Matlab implementation of the Stroke Width Transform. I hooked it up as a content script which would listen for mouse events over image elements and search for textual regions and draw semitransparent blue boxes where appropriate, and connected it to a node backend which would run tesseract to recognize characters. By the end of it all, I had enough for a pretty impressive&nbsp;demo.</p>
<p>Intermittently for more or less the entire month, I’ve been trying to improve the project- replacing some of the more hacky bits with more reliable implementations. I’ve read about some more algorithms, and experimented with different approaches to improve the method. I’m trying to add more stages to the text detection algorithm, such as the ability to segment an image into different lines, and improve the process of splitting lines into characters beyond mere connected components. But the process is rather tedious and with my limited free time, the project remains quite far away from public&nbsp;availability.</p>

            </header>
            <section class="content"><p>It must be infuriating to be in a situation where there’s a clear problem, and all the obvious remedies continually fail to produce any legitimate result. That’s what this blog is like: every month rolls by with some half baked ideas partially implemented and barely documented. And in the last day of the month, there’s a kind of panicked scramble to fulfill an entirely arbitrary self-enforced quota just to convince myself that I’m doing&nbsp;stuff.</p>
<p>Anyway, it’s pretty rare for me to be doing absolutely nothing, but mustering the effort to actually complete a project to an appreciable extent is pretty hard. This might be in some way indicative of a kind of shift in the type of projects that I try to work on- they’re generally somewhat larger in scope or otherwise more experimental. And while I may have been notorious before for not leaving projects at a well documented and completed state, these new ideas often languish much earlier in the development&nbsp;process.</p>
<p>There’s always pressure to present things only when they are complete and presentable, because after all timing is key and nothing can be more detrimental to an idea than ill-timed and poor execution. But at the same time, I think the point of this blog is to create a kind of virtual paper trail of an idea and how it evolves, regardless of whether or not it falters in its&nbsp;birth.</p>
<p>With that said, I’m going to create a somewhat brief list of projects and ideas that I’m currently experimenting with or simply have yet to publish a blog post&nbsp;for.</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the earlier entries of the backlog is a <span class="caps">HTML5</span> scramble with friends clone, acting highly performant on mobile with touch events and CSS animations while supporting keyboard based interaction on desktop. I’ve always been intending to build some kind of multiplayer real time server component so that people could compete in real time. Maybe at some point it’ll be included as a kind of mini game within&nbsp;protobowl.</li>
<li>The largest project is definitely Protobowl, which has just recently passed its one year anniversary of sorts. It’s rather odd that it hasn’t formally been given a post on this blog yet, but <em>c’est la vie</em>. Protobowl is hopefully on the verge of a rather large update which will add several oft-requested features, and maybe by then I’ll have completed something which is publishable as a blog&nbsp;post.</li>
<li>Font Interpolation/Typeface Gradients. I actually have no idea how long this has been on my todo list (years, no doubt), but the concept is actually rather nifty. With attributes like object size or color, things can be smoothly interpolated in the form of something like a gradient. The analogue for this kind of transition when applied to text would be the ability to type a word whose first letter is in one font, and the last letter being another font, with all the intermediate letters some kind of hybrid. I never did get quite far in successfully implementing it, so it may be a while until this sees the light of&nbsp;day.</li>
<li>I’ve always wanted to build a chrome extension with some amount of <span class="caps">OCR</span> or text detection capabilities so that people could select text which was embedded within an image as if it weren’t just an image. At one point I narrowed down the scope of this project so that the OCR part wasn’t even that important (the goal was then just some web worker threaded implementation of the stroke width transform algorithm and cleverly drawing some rotated boxes along with mouse movements). I haven’t had too much time to work on this so it hasn’t gone too far, but I do have a somewhat working prototype somewhere. This one too is several years&nbsp;old.</li>
<li>In the next few days, I plan on publishing a blog post I’ve been working on which is something of a humorous satire on some of the more controversial issues which have arisen this&nbsp;summer.</li>
<li>And there are several projects which have actually gotten blog posts which weren’t themselves formal announcements so much as a written version of my thinking process behind them. I haven’t actually finished the Pedant, in spite of the fact that the hardware is in theoretically something of a functional state (I remember that I built it with the intent that it could be cool to wear around during <span class="caps">MIT</span>’s CPW back in April, but classes start in a few days and it hasn’t progressed at all since). Probably one of the most promising ideas is the kind of improved, vectorized and modern approach to video lectures- but that too needs&nbsp;work.</li>
<li>I’m building the website for a local charity organization which was started by a childhood friend, and maybe I’ll publish a blog post if that ever gets deployed or&nbsp;something.</li>
</ul>

<p>I haven’t been particularly raving about Hostmonster for the near two years I’ve been a customer of their’s, and it’s time for a change. In the past week, I moved to a new web host. As of this moment, I’m using Bitcable, specifically the cheapest shared plan plus another discount. I’ve had my share of gripes about the service, but speed and reliability so far have not been among them. I discovered Bitcable through a friend who knew a friend who operated a web host, well, primarily a <span class="caps">VPS</span> service. Over a fair amount of begging for a VPS discount, I decided to try out their (I always find it awkward when referring to companies or services as a plural in spite of knowledge that it’s pretty much a one-man-show, but that makes it all the more impressive) shared plan, since that was analogous whatever I was paying for with Hostmonster. And anyway, for $2/mo, how bad can it&nbsp;get?</p>
<p>That question was a tad misleading, so far, Bitcable’s pretty awesome. Part of the thing about using a service from a friend-of-a-friend (<span class="caps">FOAF</span>, if I ever need to use an acronym later on in this post, but I’ll keep it here just because it’s a fun thing to say) is that you can get some pretty good support over some random communication channels. It’s small enough that he doesn’t oversell, and the performance really shows&nbsp;through.</p>
<p>I did, however have some issues with the configuration of the server. The first issue is that by default, shared customers don’t get <span class="caps">SFTP</span> access. That’s pretty annoying because I’ve recently fallen in love with passwordless login using public keys. I sent an angry support ticket and it was enabled soon enough. But a much more pressing issue was that soon after my migration, there was some long server outage due to some power supply failure (which thankfully, since it took over a month to write this post which is more indicative of the bad state that my blog is in than the host, hasn’t happened again, I haven’t noticed a minute of downtime since then and I’ve set uptime monitors to ensure&nbsp;that).</p>
<p>So yeah, I’ll be on this host for the foreseeable&nbsp;future.</p>

<p>This post has been hinted at by the past few blog posts, but I guess eventually it has to be written. But the basic gist is that rather than making this the home of random announcements of mostly finished projects, it’ll be the home of mostly daily (or weekly, whenever significant progress is made) and probably shorter updates on the progress certain projects. That is, the blog is transitioning back into something more like the olden days (circa 2008-ish) but without falling into the trap of using this as an alternative to having commit messages and still supporting the fact I’m now working on quite a bit more than one project at a&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>The problem is that I can’t exactly stay true to that because I actually have quite a bit of backlog in terms of stuff I have to write about, stuff which is for the most part done (so it’s not particularly viable for me to make up progress updates retroactively, and I’ll probably have to stick with writing a big blog post about&nbsp;it).</p>
<p>This should be the culmination of tons of factors and trends building up for the past year or so. I’ve always felt that the blog needed to be overhauled eventually (or end up rotting as nothing more than a backup kept in the eternal resting spot which is the Internet Archive, leaching fluids into the soil as bacterium leave the corpse punctured by holes and missing vital organs, a sure sign that I’m probably going too far into this metaphor, but in the end that’s the way many of the forums I used to visit have become). But the real spark came in the form of a migration to a new web host, something which I still alas have yet to blog about despite it happening over a week&nbsp;ago.</p>
<p>Those changes are hardly precipitous (however much anyone wants to unveil something in one flash of an instant in order to feign the appearance that everything happened suddenly and approached new heights of grandeur, that never actually happens, and it’s simply harder to work in that sort of manner - slow and steady doesn’t always lose the race). The first part was the change of the web host itself which was actually not exactly planned (I was testing out it, and unexpectedly on a whim cancelled my old web host and migrated over over the course of an afternoon and left the site down for a few hours). The second front at which this evolution occurred was a slight redesign, changing the color scheme a bit, upgrading the theme, reorganizing the categories and menus (this is meant to be chronicled in detail in some other blog post which I have yet to written). And the third and last one (which was meant to be the topic of this blog post) is a change in&nbsp;content.</p>
<p>In summary, three inevitable changes on three different fronts. Content, Frontend, and Backend. All in a not-so-grand gesture to save this blog from decaying into a moldy blob of feces on the internet’s great&nbsp;sidewalk.</p>

            <section class="content"><p>I’ve been maintaining this blog, or at least the content inside it for about five years now. It’s been through a handful of incarnations, often paired with significant changes in web hosting. I’ve had a blog for a little bit longer, but I don’t think I have the medium figured out. The structure of the posts and the style has changed over the past few years, but I can’t at this point call it evolution, a positive progression. Part of the power which lies in analyzing data is the ability to realize patterns, often at a different scale from human observation (spans of months or years) which are equally if not more&nbsp;insightful.</p>
<p>That’s been my personal attraction to data science. I’ve had a couple of personal experiments involving collecting data about my daily activities, my old writing and code in hopes of distilling the changes that I’m too conceited to admit without the infallible hand of statistics. For nearly two years now, I’ve logged my entire life within precision of approximately 30 minutes from Google Calendar (or the Calendar app on iPad which syncs to Google Calendar). Actually, the label is slightly off, I quite often dedicate large spans of time to more or less useless labels like “not productive”. But this temporal information falls apart in terms of its richness, for my schedule is dictated more so by the mandatory rhythms of school life than the drifting cadence of other&nbsp;behavior.</p>
<p>But I digress. This isn’t about why I collect data so much as “I have this data, now what?”. In this case, I had a hypothesis, a rather simple albeit morbid one at that “my blog is dying”. It’s not hard to see how I’m coming at the conclusion. I’m pretty much struggling at this point to meet my goal of one post per month (itself not a particularly difficult goal, but as time has gone on and my posts have become more infrequent, I feel more compelled to write obscenely long posts to compensate, but of course this also leads to big posts sitting there unfinished for long durations losing the sort of one post = one sitting mentality). But before I ramble for too long, I’ll cut to the chase and answer the question posed at the beginning of this paragraph: “Graphs.” (you could imagine those haunting glyphs levitating in the midst of air caught in the invisible grasp of Giorgio A. Tsoukalos, or better yet, I can spare your cognitive abilities by <a href="http://qkme.me/3qj5f6">making it real</a>)</p>
<p><a href="/articles/2012/Meta%20Analytics/blog-post-frequency.png"><div class="pic md" style="" ><img src="/articles/2012/Meta%20Analytics/blog-post-frequency.png" alt="" ><div class="caption">blog-post-frequency</div></div></a></p>
<p>Here’s a pretty little graph I made in R (sorry for the mess on the horizontal axis, and I just realized I have no idea as to how to interpret the dates, I’m assuming that they’re linear and it’s just some odd aliasing issue that makes even-numbered years repeat twice), it’s a histogram of the dates of posts that I’ve made to this blog (extracted with a simple Python script and Wordpress’s built-in Export button).You can probably actually tell that the blog’s demise is quite a long way’s coming. Every annual peak ends up shallower the following year and the first time <em>gaps</em> have actually existed was this fateful year,&nbsp;2012.</p>
<p>It’s actually sort of interesting that these peaks exist, but I can’t really tell during what months that happened during (since these axes are labeled so terribly, it’d be nice if I knew some nice interactive graph engine that worked with histograms, something like that cool time series viewer that Google had for Finance for like ever but for histograms, but I guess that just shows how much of a non-scientist I am, to have no idea how to fluently articulate in a statistical or graphical language of my&nbsp;choice).</p>
<p><a href="/articles/2012/Meta%20Analytics/Word-Count-Plot.png"><div class="pic md" style="" ><img src="/articles/2012/Meta%20Analytics/Word-Count-Plot.png" alt="" ><div class="caption">Word Count Plot</div></div></a></p>
<p>For more graph fun, here’s a scatter plot of word lengths as a function of year. I wasn’t dedicated enough to figure out how to get <a href="http://nltk.org/"><span class="caps">NLTK</span></a> to tell me the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunning_fog_index">Gunning-Fog</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_test">Flesch-Kincaid</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Readability_Index"><span class="caps">ARI</span></a> value for individual posts, and I doubt that would end up showing anything particularly insightful. But yeah, so here it is. Charts. Charts of words. Note that thing that sticks out clocking in at around 3724 words is my first <a href="http://antimatter15.com/wp/2011/05/uploading-mp3s-to-google-music-beta-from-linux-chrome-os-win-and-mac/">Music Alpha</a>&nbsp;post.</p>
<p>Actually, I won’t mind that Wordpress isn’t yet self aware (‘ello Skynet) and still sends trackbacks and pings (whatever they are) to me when I link to myself. Seriously, you <em>don’t actually need to have a self-aware artificial intelligence in order to learn how to not spam me with emails when I’m quite probably as in super definitely aware of its existence</em>. But anyway, I guess I’ll stomach the lurching pain of a thousand emails (I’m using hyperbole here, in case your rudimentary artificial intelligence algorithms can’t quite distinguish them, but I’m also pretty sure your algorithms wouldn’t be able to handle n-th degrees of meta, so this excruciatingly useless parenthetical wouldn’t be much other than that: excruciatingly useless) and post the last part of the list&nbsp;here.</p>

</code></pre><p>That list was compiled by the command <code>cat blogtimes.csv | sort -t&#39;,&#39; -k3n | tail</code>, and that’s quite an accomplishment because I had to look up the arguments for the <code>sort</code> command in order to figure that out. Of course, <code>blogtimes.csv</code> is the output of my magical six line python script (which uses BeautifulSoup to extract all the <code>wp:post_date</code>s).</p>
<p>So, with 10 blog posts in that list, every single 8 of them happened after 2011 and 3 of them happened in 2012. Considering that there were 10 things published in 2012 (according to my dataset) and 21 in 2011, that’s a rather significant fraction of the stuff which has been written recently to be insanely&nbsp;long.</p>
<p>Wordpress tells me this post is now at 948 words, so I guess I’ll add a bit of concluding at the end to push it over the magical power-of-ten barrier, so presumably you should brace for the terrible boom which occurs at this point (oh, what’s that? I think that’s my imaginary telephone operator who informs me when I make a factual error, apparently those kinds of booms only happen with waves, and apparently words flowing through word count orders of magnitude don’t&nbsp;count).</p>
<p>The original title of this post was “Meta Analytics <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Upcoming Changes”, but in the spirit of the upcoming changes, I’ve moved the “Upcoming Changes” part into its own post (tentatively titled “Upcoming Changes”). You can probably at this point guess that “Upcoming Changes” involves something to tackle the excessive verbosity and to mitigate the absurdly infrequent posts. This probably doesn’t sound nearly as heroic to you as it does to me, because I’m listening to The Avengers soundtrack right now, and “A Promise” is pretty&nbsp;dramatic.</p>

            <section class="content"><p>Not that anyone is going to particularly miss my blog (most of my other web pages will still be up because I’m far too lazy to go through all of them in order to make a slightly less futile protest). But this is one of the most interesting internetwide events that I’ve ever encountered, and I should be shamed to not take part in it. Copyright and its ongoing war with libertarian and anarchist mentalities has fascinated me ever since squinting through Free Culture on my iPhone more than five year ago. Going to Jonathan Zittrain’s Free Culture X keynote a few years ago was fun&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>I’m sure most would feel uncomfortable with my characterization of this as some cyberlibertarian movement, but I think it’s an entirely excusable position for someone living through a period of adolescence characterized by rebellion and Ayn Rand. It’s certainly not the only perspective, but it seems the most poignant and consistent, not that consistency is necessarily a goal of any legislative body. Legislative bodies are meant, to borrow from programming jargon, to monkey-patch a framework that ill-approximates the societal expectation of&nbsp;government.</p>
<p>Now excuse me while I contrive a metaphor that relates to something that I don’t know much about and will seem cringe-worthy to anyone knowledgeable in the subject. Lets say that the Earth is the shape of what the ideal government is. Not ideal in a sense that it’s perfect and elegant, but in the sense that it is empirically derived through the scientific process of experiment. But in large part, this mass conforms to a very general principle (maximizing individual freedoms). I would characterize this is approximating the earth as a sphere. For nearly all applications, this rather crude geometric model works astonishingly well, leading some to even believe that this is what the world <em>actually</em> is. That everything else, the obsession with finding imperfection is actually a delusion and everything comes from measurement error (well, that’s when this metaphor breaks down because nobody actually does this). Legislators shape the body of law to conform with the needs of society by poking and adding ridges to where the overlay is incongruous. They do the passive activity of fixing the model, the geoid, to incredible precision. But there’s a more radical way, molding the earth into what our model was. We can forget about the lapses, and soon enough the surface of hte earth will erode down into that perfect sphere of&nbsp;ideology.</p>
<p>There. I think I’ve fulfilled my obligation to write some words with some ostensible meaning with regard to something that pertains rather dearly to my life. If this passes and we descend into a dystopian nightmare reminiscent of 1984, at least I’ll have something to look back on. An old man filled with regret waiting to die alone. Or at least without an internet. I did my best (but still far from enough, as is anything besides martyrdom) to preserve crowd immunity to hazardous legislation, but alas we were&nbsp;stricken.</p>

<p>You may notice that the site is now using my actual domain! and that it’s also like twice as fast and 20 times more reliable! Also, the URLs are now insanely awesome rather than the ?p=314159 or something random like that.
That’s because I have a new host and this is a new site with WordPress 2.8.1 and stuff.
One thing I momentarily have forgotten is Ads (don’t you love them?). So they’ll be back soon.
I also have a new theme, based on the SimpleX and Carrington Blog themes.
I went back hundred or so posts and added catagories and tags to them for ease of navigation. I created new pages for Wikify, vXJS, ShinyTouch and MirrorTouch and I have a few new posts.
So I’d like to see your feedback on the new&nbsp;site.</p>

<p>So now I have a cool new web host: Dreamhost. I’ll be using it for at least the next year. So far it’s really great. It has everything I really wanted which isn’t much (aside from <span class="caps">SSH</span> access).
Sure, it’s a massive overseller which has quite sky-high pricing for the purpose of bailing out really insanely cheap promotions, but I haven’t yet faced any problems with it. And may I mention that I’m largely a member because of one of their insanely cheap promotions? Don’t get me wrong, I did do tons of research prior and it seemed good to begin with, but the whole July Fourth $10 for hosting a whole year is pretty irrefutably awesome.  decently fast. It actually supports URLs without a WWW (which was the reason this blog never used GoDaddy).
So what issues have I faced so far? Well, not many. And since setting up is usually the most troublesome and hard part, it’s setting a good precedent in my mind. Issues ive has aren’t really hosting related.
The control panel is actually really good. I don’t know why, but I really can’t stand using CPanel. I haven’t had a very good experience with it. They try far too much to make everything as if it’s intended to be something like your Netvibes or iGoogle homepage. And CPanel is remarkably unhelpful with issues (that I’ve had with SSH) and it wastes a lot of screen estate on listing basic server info that rarely changes or is useful in any way. The Dreamhost panel by comparison is menu based and intuitive. No big icons that make you feel stupid after looking for a long time and realizing it’s a huge icon in the center of the screen involving outdated and vague old desktop metaphors. Just simple menus. Sometimes it’s not very good at explaining why it switches PHP to CGI mode when you use the automatic installer. I wouldn’t reccomend it’s automated installer though. While I’ve had very few problems with using it to install the latest version of Wordpress, the configuration is a bit lacking. Also, the generated wp_config.php from the automated installer is old and actually missing a few security features that makes it harder (just add the missing lines in) to install BBPress later on. Beside that, installing Trac+SVN may be only a dew clicks to do, but getting Trac to behave as expected (logging in) requires tedious amounts of command-line-fu. The installation options are seriously quite mediocre and they use big icons too. There are only like 9 available scripts with only a few CMSes a gallery or two and some eCommerce.
I can’t really do a summary, but it’s pretty good as of now.
Oh and another cool thing is that this entire post was written on my iPhone. Yes. On a touchscreen device with a virtual keyboard. And that’s not bad either. I’m typing quite fast on this device and not making too many mistakes either. The reason the first post from my iPhone came so latenis because Wordpress for iPhone didn’t work on my old web host, but it works on my new&nbsp;one.</p>

Mapped out all the dependencies, installed them all, and then popped up a nice user-friendly config window where you select which server to install it in.
<div class="pic md" style="" ><img src="/articles/2009/I%27m%20A%20Linux%20Idiot/lamp4.gif" alt="" ></div>
I had Apache2, so i just hit enter. Opened up my browser and went to /phpmyadmin. hmm. 404? tried /phpMyAdmin, and&nbsp;same.</p>
<p>So I googled it, and there were all these success stories. I went and tried <tt>sudo dpkg-reconfigure phpmyadmin</tt>, that same window popped up, this time i tabbed over to the ok button. and pressed enter. Checked again, still&nbsp;broken?</p>

Just like two weeks ago I hit a TOTAL of 500 spam, now it’s close to&nbsp;1200.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, I’m actually pretty happy of this. Spam is an indication of people actually visiting it. Even though virtually nobody comments (still a lot more than the early days of the&nbsp;blog).</p>
<p>And the stuff at <a href="http://antimatter15.110mb.com/phpfusion/">http://antimatter15.110mb.com/phpfusion/</a> is really spammy now :( I built a quick-n-dirty spam filter for it, and it’s database is over 7mb&nbsp;!!!!</p>
