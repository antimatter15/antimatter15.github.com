              Hi. I’m <b>Kevin Kwok</b>, and I’m currently a sophomore at <b>MIT</b>, 
              and this is my obligatory online presence or whatever.  
            </p>
            <p>
              I regularly updated this site from 2007, when I started it in elementary school, 
              to summer 2014, when it was unwittingly absorbed into an international phishing ring.
            </p>
            <p>
              But like a phoenix, hydra or the national deficit, the site is back 
              again bigger than ever (after a rather long gestation period).
            </p>
            <p>
              For more obnoxious autobiographical content 
              blended with bits of nostalgia for the old PHP-on-sketchy-free-webhosting days, <a href="/about/">click here.</a>

<p>I’ve actually had this post fermenting in my blog’s draft folder since at least September, but I never actually got around to finishing the post. And now that Google’s enabling the new swipe-to-go-back by default on the dev channel versions of Chrome <span class="caps">OS</span>, it finally feels like the right time to post. As in, I feel like posting things right when they’re soon to be absolutely useless (Which, you might recall, was the case with my Google Wave client, which started selling on the App Store the day Google announced that Wave would be phased out and eventually shut&nbsp;down).</p>
<p>So, a few months ago, I finished my update to the<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/swipe-gesture/mgegfjnccpnkdppohmfgnjalkediapkc?hl=en-US"> Swipe Gesture </a>extension, which featured a rather significant redesign. It supported multiple gesture directions and a fancy animated element to indicate the direction of the&nbsp;gesture.</p>

<p>So I’m trying something new, returning to quasi-daily somewhat short updates about the development of whatever I’m working on rather than withholding everything until something of somewhat acceptable release quality is achieved. I have a blog post about that transition, but I’m still working on it (as in, writing it is somewhat boring). It’s probably better given my development cycle is quite nonlinear, usually I get something somewhat promising made in the first few days or so and pause for long and possibly indefinite durations doing other stuff in the process. Probably, writing short blog posts about what I have yet to finish will remind me to, well, finish them. Just maybe. But I’m probably going to have to preface every post that I write with this kind of disclaimer until I actually get that post finished and published so I have something to reference rather than pointing crazily into the air and saying “oh yeah, it’s coming, now, someday,&nbsp;maybe.”.</p>
<p>Starting about yesterday, I started working on the successor to Swipe Gesture. The new version tries to mimic the actual behavior of Chrome on Lion, which I think is really quite cool. Here’s a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-LY6-UdtO8">video I found on YouTube</a> which shows how it basically looks like if you aren’t familiar with it. The first thing to notice that it’s substantially less trivial, code-wise. No more is it a 30-line software lightweight, but it’s not _too _complex and arcane to forbid any kind of comprehension. Now, the simple prototype of its functionality is already nearing 300 lines of&nbsp;code.</p>
<p><a href="/articles/2012/Swipe%20Gesture%202%20Development/Screenshot-from-2012-08-14-111944.png"><div class="pic md" style="" ><img src="/articles/2012/Swipe%20Gesture%202%20Development/Screenshot-from-2012-08-14-111944-150x150.png" alt="" ><div class="caption">Screenshot from 2012-08-14 11:19:44</div></div></a></p>
<p>Another big difference is now it’s no longer designed strictly for Chromebooks. In fact, one of the reasons for starting this was that I was informed that the kind of functionality might be useful on Macbooks running Windows via Bootcamp. In fact, it’s meant to be as general as possible, to work on pretty much any kind of platform. And it’s not even bound strictly to the horizontal axis: the code is meant to work with linear swipes in any direction including diagonally (although some experimentation on my chromebook seems to indicate that swiping at angles isn’t terribly&nbsp;useful).</p>
<p>The most significant conceptual change is the transition between a speed/acceleration metric to a distance metric. That is, in the old version, an action was triggered when there was a swipe in one direction vigorous enough to be considered. This was a fairly simple way to avoid the problem of distinguishing between a horizontal scroll action and a swipe by not making a distinction. In a sense, cheating. The new version instead does things “the right way™” by observing events carefully to determine if a swiping action actually results in scrolling. If that’s your kind of thing, the technical nitty gritty details have their own <a href="http://antimatter15.com/wp/2012/08/determining-if-a-mousewheel-event-results-in-scroll/">dedicated blog post</a>, so feel free to click through if you’re&nbsp;interested.</p>
<p>Once it’s determined that that scroll thing is actually probably a swipe gesture, it renders a nice little arrow in canvas. I considered using a unicode arrow and setting the font to huge, but that didn’t turn out quite as well as I expected (plus, it makes rotations and interactions with the embedding page <span class="caps">CSS</span> a little less&nbsp;predictable).</p>
<p>Also another thing is that it turns out that it’s a bad idea to set a css transition on something which is meant to hook with mouse or scroll movements because, while this ends up smoothing things out (which is good for mouse wheels because they click to the nearest 120 magical click units) it ends up producing a significant amount of lag and just feels so&nbsp;awkward.</p>

<p>Another thing (since this post is written over the course of several days, and the actual update has already been published at time of writing) is the cool redesign of the Settings page. The first thing to notice is that the settings page for once actually has settings, which is quite an accomplishment by itself. Also, it has a visual refresh that makes it look somewhat bootstrap-esque. That’s because ever since using Bootstrap in the making of Protobowl (a rather big project that I have yet to blog about), I’ve pretty much fallen in love with the color <code>whiteSmoke</code>. Partly because it has a name, which means I don’t have to google it or tattoo it on my arm for a mnemonic’s sake, and also because it’s a pretty nice&nbsp;color.</p>

<p>So I was testing the responsiveness of the Samsung Series 5 Chromebook touchpad and made a short little script which basically continuously adds the mousewheel changes and draws them using canvas. But it appears that the trackpad does some kind of fitting to make things tend to be at right angles, though it’s not hard to get something diagonal or even somewhat&nbsp;circular.</p>

<p>So here’s a somewhat technical post, actually it’s pretty technical. But either way the premise is sort of simple to understand, and probably so is the context. I’m working on Swipe Gesture 2.0, which basically tries to take Chrome and Safari on <span class="caps">OS</span> X Lion’s awesome back-forward transitions and make them work on other operating systems. See, the thing is that multitouch isn’t _strictly _a requirement for it to work, a lot of computers just have the little bars on the bottom and right of the track bar (often with a little somewhat abrasive textured surface so you don’t accidentally tread upon it). Regardless, the title is a bit of a misnomer, because even though the event is called the “mousewheel”, it’s hardly meant to be observed from an actual mouse (or a wheel), instead it means the scrolling gesture on some kind of trackpad, either multitouch or&nbsp;not.</p>
<p>Well, first, I guess I’ll talk about the difference between how Lion and Leopard do it. The way Leopard did it was pretty cool but not particularly applicable to other platforms since it relied on the existence of a three-finger gesture. As in, you needed some kind of touchpad which was cool enough to support three-finger multiouch, <em>reliably</em>. It also behaved completely independent of the current zoom or scroll position, which makes implementation in software entirely trivial given access to some drivers which can recognize three fingers on a&nbsp;touchpad.</p>
<p>Lion did it a completely different way. Instead of creating an entirely new gesture which was entirely dedicated to the singular task of navigating through history, it conflated the notions of scrolling with navigating, which sort of makes sense. Apple’s quite dedicated to skeuomorphic metaphors, and they want to treat the web more like <em>literal pages</em>. A user can move it around to better keep certain things in view, and the physical movement to slide a sheet out of view is just an extension of that panning&nbsp;gesture.</p>
<p>However, technically this poses a completely different challenge, because this requires you to distinguish between scrolls and navigation requests. Scrolling is always the default behavior, but the navigation swipe gesture happens when scrolling wouldn’t actually result in anything. However, many implementations of scrolling are at least somewhat kinetic, often it’s emphasized in software (in the form of smooth-scrolling) or hardware (scroll wheels that don’t click but instead move basically freely) or because your arm has to obey the laws of kinematics (unless it doesn’t, in which case that’s certainly fascinating). So not only does the software have to determine when a mouse wheel action results manifests as a scroll, it has to see if it was the user’s intent to do the extraneous&nbsp;scrolling.</p>
<p>This is done by clustering the mouse wheel movements together temporally. Scroll events flow in in discrete chunks, and you can split events off into little buckets (in a sense), where if there isn’t any event sent within some arbitrary threshold (say, 500msecs or half a second), you stick stuff in a new bucket. This way, lets say you scroll from the top of the page to the bottom and you’re sort of excited, and spin the wheel as fast as possible, you hit the bottom of the page but it’s not some instant stop. You continue scrolling (because you’re just that excited, and just can’t stop) for a little bit more. Ignoring the fact that you probably won’t have a vertical/horizontal event handler (though there are some sort of intriguing possibilities for this, one idea is to have the upper threshold trigger full screen). Without segmenting them into certain buckets, it doesn’t recognize that the time when you’re ramming into the top of the page is part of the same general gesture as when you were scrolling, and it may interpret that as an intentional gesture. So that’s one part which makes it a bit more&nbsp;complex.</p>
<p>So now, you have these series of <code>mousewheel</code> events conveniently delimited into little gesture-chunks. The next part is determining whether or not the gesture-chunks are part of a scroll action or&nbsp;not.</p>
<p>Thankfully that’s a really simple thing to do. Just look at the document’s scrollTop and check if it’s zero (or scrollLeft for horizontal stuff) or whatever value is the width of the element. If it can’t scroll no more, then you have a winner and you can start the falling balloons and&nbsp;confetti.</p>
<p>Except it’s not that easy, because the document isn’t the only thing which can scroll. Thanks to the glory of <code>overflow:scroll</code>, there are lots of things which can scroll. Things which aren’t necessarily documents may be in arbitrary scroll positions to wreak havoc on your well-meaning&nbsp;heuristics.</p>
<p>So back to the drawing board, I guess. Actually, to think of it, maybe it’s simpler to listen for the <code>scroll</code> event, which fires when a scroll happens, and quite intuitively doesn’t fire when a scroll doesn’t happen. And mouse wheel actions always precede scroll ones (because the wheel events bubble and are cancelable, so you can prevent a scroll from happening). The only problem is that scroll events don’t bubble. As in, when a scroll event happens on some element, it’s not going to show up on the document, it’s only going to show up if you’re listening on that specific element at the right point in&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>The naive approach to this dilemma is just to attach a scroll listener to every single event on the document, and to reattach to some other elements whenever the <span class="caps">DOM</span> tree is modified in some way. This means the overhead grows rather significantly when pages are larger, in a way which could be likened to O(n) time where n represents the number of nodes in the document. If you want, you could lazily do it by attaching the scroll listener only once the wheel event has fired, but that would cause a significant delay when attempting to legitimately&nbsp;scroll.</p>
<p>Another thing you could do, is to make another assumption: that the element which gets scrolled has to be some parent of the element which the mouse is currently over. Making that assumption, we can add a <code>mousewheel</code> listener to the root of the document, as those kinds of events actually do bubble. And since they’re mouse events, once you capture it, you can get a <code>clientX</code> and <code>clientY</code>, comprising the current coordinates of the mouse. And with that, you can get the element immediately below the cursor with <code>document.elementFromPoint</code>. And since the scroll might fire on any one of the elements which are parents of the current element, you ascend up the tree and add a listener on all of those (until, of course you hit the document element, at which point you can’t go any further up). This yields performance which could essentially be modeled with O(log n), quite a bit better than&nbsp;O(n).</p>
<p>So now the finished process is fairly simple, you listen for a mousewheel event, and when it happens we determine the element, and ascend the tree, yada yada. That scroll listener, when fired, sets a global variable <code>lastDetectedScroll</code> to the current timestamp. We set a little temporary variable set to the before time and then we set a little timer, 150 milliseconds. It usually only takes like four to see if a scroll thingy happened, but let’s be safe by having an order-of-magnitude threshold. The Cuckoo clock rings, and we check if the <code>lastDetectedScroll</code> is the same thing, and if it is, it’s a swipe, and otherwise, it’s a&nbsp;scroll.</p>
<p>Here’s a little demo: <a href="http://antimatter15.com/misc/experiments/swipe-gesture/minimal.html">http://antimatter15.com/misc/experiments/swipe-gesture/minimal.html</a></p>

<p>Here’s an extension which I actually released<a href="https://plus.google.com/116347431032639424492/posts/K4xgL8SKKQU"> some time back</a>, but never got around to writing a blog post for. Part of the reason was that the early reviews didn’t quite pan out, in large part due to <em>not working</em>. But I was using my Chromebook and I somehow felt a vague longing for some kind of multitouch gesture, and remembered that I had made this little extension (which I had disabled for some reason). Anyway, this is as appropriate a time as any to formally announce it to my probably remarkably small blog&nbsp;readership.</p>
<p>There is, however a tad bit of difficulty representing the function of it in pictures because really, it doesn’t have a big <span class="caps">UI</span>. It makes hardware more useful, and in its idealized form, should have no interface. But of course, we don’t live in a place where apps are perfectly idealized and either way, Apple has <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/what-is/gestures.html">plenty of nice pretty pictures</a> of people swiping fingers to the&nbsp;right.</p>
<p>I really fell in love with the Macbook multitouch gestures, almost at first sight. They just seemed so natural and so beautiful that I sort of felt that that was like the epitome of design or <span class="caps">HCI</span> perfection. And from that point, any time I used a laptop which wasn’t made by Apple (or even the ones which were made by Apple but were stuck in the barbaric ages preceding the inclusion of the glass multitouch pad, where its invention might have produced a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Creaci%C3%B3n_de_Ad%C3%A1n.jpg">scene like this</a>), I felt thoroughly&nbsp;disgusted.</p>
<p>Flipping through the Chromium <span class="caps">OS</span> design papers, there is one page dedicated specifically to<a href="http://dev.chromium.org/user-experience/multitouch"> cool multitouch gestures</a> which could be used. And as far as I’m aware the Samsung Series 5 550 (the new chromebook) is the only device which supports these gestures (thus far), and even then it’s only pinch to zoom and forward/back (three finger). All the other Chromebook users have been left&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>Another cool thing about the implementation is that it uses a certain <code>webkitDirectionInvertedFromDevice</code> property of the <code>mousewheel</code> events, which gives you a boolean value about whether or not the platform you’re on has some magical direction inversion like on <span class="caps">OS</span> X Lion or if you’ve enabled “simple scrolling” on Chrome OS. But this might not have been a good idea since swipe directions too are sort of inverted on those platforms naturally as well, so it might be better to _not _compensate for&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Anyway, the implementation is actually quite simple. The current version doesn’t even break the 40 line mark, because all it does it it listens for <code>mousewheel</code> events on every page (via a content script), and it calculates the current acceleration. If that acceleration ever passes a certain threshold, it triggers a forward or back action. Right now, the threshold is preconfigured based on my own testing on a Samsung Series 5 (note, not 550) chromebook. But for people with other devices, I’m working on a second version which will be slightly more Apple-esque in its&nbsp;implementation.</p>

            <section class="content"><p><a href="https://github.com/antimatter15/cloudfall"><div class="pic md" style="" ><img src="/articles/2012/CloudFall%20A%20Text%20Editor/Screenshot-from-2012-07-06-090534.png" alt="" ><div class="caption">Screenshot from 2012-07-06 09:05:34</div></div></a></p>
<p>This is probably a horrible time to think of writing an online text editor. The “market”, if you can call it that, is virtually saturated with worthy contenders and (figuratively) every day is marked by the entrance of some other text editor to the already crowded space. Part of the problem is that now, web based text editing components are actually pretty awesome. Ace and CodeMirror work really quite well and each have associated with them some very formidable integrated development environments, referring to Cloud9 and LightTable, respectively (albeit there are quite a few others, these seem to be probably the most funded). And at Google I/O 2012, they announced the new Chrome Packaged Apps, which expose new functionality (most relevant being the ability to open and save files from the local disk and operating offline by default), and their sample apps include no less than two text&nbsp;editors.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I’ve always pined (probably an exaggeration) for the opportunity to indulge in something as meta as writing a text editor which I could use as a text editor for the text editor (which is, if you did not notice, that text editor). It’s probably the pinnacle of dogfooding (probably nice coming after a streak of making extensions that I never actually use). But this doesn’t really go anywhere in terms of explaining why I’m doing this rather than using someone else’s rather better developed text editor package. It really comes down to this chrome app which I was quite a fan of almost a year ago, called SourceKit. SourceKit is a text editor which runs in Chrome that synced with Dropbox. The version which was distributed on the Chrome Web Store never supported offline, which is sort of sad because that’s the one feature I really wanted. The other source of inspiration was Streamie, the real time node based twitter client which had an absolutely phenomenal scheme for contributing. You just needed to fork the repo on github and all your commits would be visible live on your own subdomain of the&nbsp;site.</p>
<p>Also, in the mean time, I had discovered this pretty awesome text editor (no, it’s not <span class="caps">VI</span> or Emacs, because I’m not nearly cool enough or dedicated enough to approach that steep precipice of a learning curve) called Sublime Text 2. I have a pretty good picture now of what exactly I want from a text editor based on that (actually, I don’t know if this is just some delusion which has manifested in my mind because I probably thought the same way about gedit and krita and komodo and aptana and notepad2 and notepad++ and dreamweaver before&nbsp;that).</p>
<p>The real drive to creating that text editor happened in the week before I was scheduled to attend Google I/O 2012. I knew I’d be in some situations lacking Internet, and I felt like writing words or code or something in that time. So in a few days I hacked together this text editor which had a vague resemblance to Sublime Text. It was based on Ace, like SourceKit before it, but obviously a newer version with a whole bunch of syntax and themes included. It used a modified version of the Dropbox component from SourceKit (it was changed moderately to accommodate Dropbox <span class="caps">API</span> 2.0 and to deal with binary things like array buffers and blobs). And I added a little heads-up-menu-esque file and command picker, quite reminiscent of Sublime Text (and to a lesser extent Ubuntu&nbsp;Unity).</p>
<p>And then I headed for the airplane having not actually used it much in practice hoping to be super productive while using it, which you could have probably been able to tell by the beginning of this sentence wouldn’t pan out. The first (quite major) flaw which I encountered was some bug which would end up wiping out any file that I tried to edit, and left me with a gaping chasm in my hard drive (this is a metaphor, because my Chromebook is solid state). I just hope nothing of value was lost, but it remains quite likely that it was the&nbsp;otherwise.</p>
<p>I had no real system for testing out changes to my own extension, and I was too paralyzed of the fear of deleting my own extension to try changing it. So the end result was that the entire duration passed with me hardly doing anything productive on the project, or using it for any productive means in itself. All that happened was my discovery that everyone is working on a text editor right now and I should probably quit right then and there and work on something perhaps more novel or productive. But I came back and fixed it and did some more on it, and I’m finally at the point at which I feel comfortable using it for some mostly useless things, like writing a blog post inside the project’s readme about the project&nbsp;itself.</p>
<p>Welcome to CloudFall. Yeah, I’m aware how dumb it sounds, but the fact that the new James Bond movie is going to be called Skyfall essentially demolishes any hope of using that name. But rather than using this as a vindication of how cool that name would be and abandoning it for some novel name, I’m just going to contrive something in a similar vain, hence the current working name. But rather than spending the first few lines complaining about the name of the product, I should probably lay down what exactly this project aims to be. It’s a text editor, not a terribly glamorous concept, I know, and this is especially not a terribly great time to start. This is hardly the first text editor, and certainly will not be the last (until this either never finishes or the world actually does end by the end of this year). It’s not the most full featured, but I guess it does need to have something which distinguishes&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The main feature is largely inherited from SourceKit, which is the ability to sync with Dropbox. And instead of editing “live” off of Dropbox’s servers, it really is more of a sync. It’s built around Chrome’s FileSystem <span class="caps">API</span>, so it has its own sandboxed imaginary folder where it sticks all the files. Every time a file is loaded, it’s first downloaded onto its spot on the imaginary folder and subsequent edits get sent to both the local copy and the server. This architecture, in theory, means it probably won’t inadvertently overwrite, corrupt or delete your important data in the advent of some syncing issues. It keeps track of the latest synced revisions and tells Dropbox’s API that information so that it won’t try overwriting a newer version from elsewhere and It’ll somewhat gracefully save to a different file in such a circumstance (though that routine can hardly be declared well tested, so beware of complications). It should in that way retain very close to full functionality while offline, since just about everything it does is entirely offline (including the compilation of CoffeeScript and LESS, which is explained later&nbsp;on).</p>
<p>Built into the extension are a few of the tiny tweaks that I have installed on Sublime Text which I find fairly useful. For instance, the app includes a copy of the CoffeeScript and <span class="caps">LESS</span> compilers, and so whenever you are editing one of those types of files in the text editor, it’ll automatically compile and save it into the same directory whenever you hit the save key. That’s actually pretty useful because it gives CoffeeScript back that REPL (almost certainly a malapropism, but I’m not too familiar with developer work-cycle jargon, so please excuse that grievous offense) dynamic that JS developers are so familiar with. And to aid that sort of work, it can preview your files “live”, even offline. While it can’t open and edit binary files like pictures, it can still download and display them&nbsp;fine.</p>
<p>For writing walls of text which don’t really need syntax highlighting (I wonder if someone has a package on mainstream text editors that syntax highlights free form English grammar, sort of like giving people synesthesia for no real reason), it includes a word count widget. Also, because I feel like encouraging unhealthy behavior, right next to the word count is an indication of your current typing speed. I’m pretty sure someone could go into some moral discussion into why it’s a completely detrimental addition to create something which displays how quickly the author is typing because it encourages a mindset which doesn’t focus on creating the most concise or effective means of delivery for some message, but rather promotes meaningless verbosity. But sometimes I would imagine using this for school assignments and the ilk, and maybe it would be nice to know when I’m reaching my designated quota filling some unwritten word requirement. I’m not quite sure how reliable of a word count it gives, since the algorithm is primitive and by no means nuanced, but it should be able to give a sort of rough estimate of the number of words on a&nbsp;page.</p>
<p>I may have mentioned earlier that there are two primary systems for interacting with the application, both of which are keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl-O and Ctrl-P, meaning the file browser and the command palette, respectively. They both appear in the same sort of interface component and generally behave the same, but there are some slight differences in how they operate (obviously). There are actually two “browsing modes” for the file browser, where it shows files either from the local stored cache or online in Dropbox. That can be switched by selecting either “Browse Mode: Local Copy” or “Browse Mode: Remote Dropbox” from the command palette (though there should probably be some better interface logically placed on the file browser panel itself). Remote Dropbox only works when the user is online, so the default mode is the local one. The sole interface to this list of files is the filter search box on the bottom of that widget, where typing in stuff filters out things. Of the visible items, the cursor can be manipulated by using the arrow keys, and one of the options can be executed by hitting the enter key. The widget needs to be manually dismissed by hitting the Esc key (which allows you to semi-rapidly open several files or try different commands, like changing themes). When a folder is activated, the context then shifts to what is inside the folder, descending into the hierarchy. It’s possible to ascend by entering the directory “../“. To create a file or folder (Note that at time of writing, creating folders does not sync to Dropbox), just type “+yourfile.txt” (or if there are no search results, it’ll automatically select the option to create a file with that name). To delete a file, you likewise just prepend your command with a minus instead, for instance “-oldfile.txt”. It’s not nearly as counterintuitive or confusing as I presume this description is making it&nbsp;sound.</p>
<p>The command palette, given that the interface is basically the same has much in common with the file system, but it’s entirely flat and linear. It lacks the hierarchy that plagues the file system, and navigating it is considerably simpler. Since the list is filtered and updated live with every keystoke, it’s fairly easy to find whatever command you’re looking for. The filtering algorithm only searches for characters but disregards gaps, only paying attention to order. In other words, the query “seals”, may match “SEt SyntAx: coLdfuSion”, it also means that you can construct very short queries to find what you&nbsp;want.</p>
<p>At this point, I don’t think it’s a final project per se, there are still a few features are woefully dysfunctional like Find and Replace. But I think it fits my own use case, editing files on my Chromebook, even when offline. It’s fast and doesn’t take too many steps to start. But the interface isn’t exceedingly intuitive (Basically everything is accessed through two keyboard shortcuts). I haven’t found a witty logo for it (I just haven’t bothered looking), and at this point I’m just writing a blog post about it because I feel obligated to document whatever it is that I just&nbsp;did.</p>
<p>Maybe some day I’ll pick it up again, or if there’s some response at all to this blog post, and add those awesome collaboration features (which probably won’t be very useful because the entire thing is quite hackish and not particularly kind to the prospect of improvements). Maybe I’ll fix up the search and replace interface (read: get rid of whatever horrid mess exists and replace it with a new one from scratch). And maybe I might publish it in some form that is significantly less involved than <a href="https://github.com/antimatter15/cloudfall">cloning off github</a> and packaging the app&nbsp;yourself.</p>

<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/obojocfchdgdpgcigcdhdnlakfcbbgfn"><strong>MusicAlpha</strong> </a>works again, and this wasn’t some minor update that fixed a small hole, the entire app has been rewritten. There’s a new user interface which has really quite beautiful animated polar progress bars, but the most significant part is that the mystical protobufs-over-https protocol has been decoded and&nbsp;documented.</p>
<p>It really started on January 30th, when <a href="https://github.com/simon-weber">Simon Weber</a> contacted me for information on the upload process because his <a href="https://github.com/simon-weber/Unofficial-Google-Music-API">Unofficial-Google-Music-<span class="caps">API</span></a> received various user requests to implement uploading. I remembered a message sent a little while earlier offering help decoding the protobufs and tried out the method described, which involved using a disassembler to patch the curl_easy_setopt method to disable checking of <span class="caps">SSL</span> certificates. This turned out to be the trick and I used Fiddler to collect a few dumps of data for subsequent analysis. That was really quite a magical moment because everything afterwards was relatively straightforward. The huge stumbling block which had prohibited progress for these past months had been lifted and the task which was left, of reverse engineering the protocol, seemed eminently viable. With only minor hiccups over the next few days, I built a python prototype of the program. I created a .proto file which was somewhat human readable with field names based on guesses.We realized some pretty cool things or at least got a much better understanding of how Google Music seems to work (This blog post was started in the early part of February, but I’m finishing this up halfway through&nbsp;March).</p>
<p>For instance, the reason Music Manager doesn’t work on virtual machines is because they use the computer’s <span class="caps">MAC</span> address as a system for identifying individual devices. They have a cap on the number of devices which can be authorized to manage your music, which is currently set to 10. This caused a bit of confusion when I hit that device cap while testing (At one point I assumed that the MAC-esque field was actually a random string, so after fifteen or so tests everything started silently failing). However, it occurs to me that it isn’t particularly interesting to read the narrative of how exactly the current version of the application has come to exist. The technical overview of how the actual protocol works can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/antimatter15/google-music-protocol">google-music-protocol</a> project page on Github. It includes a brief overview of the mechanism as well as sections which detail the specific messages which are sent to the server and also includes a simple reference implementation. Hopefully it should be enough information for anyone who is actually interested in doing something which relates to it (though I am curious if anyone could possibly create something interesting out of it, please contact me if you decide to do anything at all with it). So at this point, I’d like to skip over to the actual application-specific aspect: MusicAlpha itself. This is the story of how the rewrite came to be, and the rather lengthy time it took to to write this blog post describing&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>One of the first things I realized was that the entire application would essentially need to be rewritten. The code dealt primarily with altering the attributes of a song by mimicking the web client’s interface, something which wouldn’t be very useful now that all the metadata is sent via the magical protobufs scheme. Since that code gets scrapped, I figured why not scrap the rest. I wrote the first version while experimenting with darker color schemes and obscenely prominent border radii and gradients. I’m not sure that I can say it’s objectively better, but it does look a bit more interesting, especially that big two-ringed polar&nbsp;chart.</p>
<p>There’s some text to the right side, but it’s not particularly of interest. There’s a big file selection button, but that’s pretty uninteresting. Embroidered on the solid gray backdrop is the logo, a simple and unchanged music symbol- unchanged from the last version. I used, for the first time, custom web typography. Just some fancy looking sans-serif fonts I picked from Google’s Font Library. On the old application, I had two progress bars to show the upload progress, one is for individual songs and the other is the overall progress. I wanted to portray upload progress in a manner which was somewhat smoother and more aesthetically alluring than a mere linear&nbsp;bar.</p>
<p>In trying to create that better progress bar, I created a polar progress bar in canvas. All updates are smoothly interpolated and watching the bars spin around and invert is somewhat reminiscent to staring at an old record spin on a turntable, something which I’ve only seen a few times in my (rather short, at this moment) life, but magical enough to still inspire a sense of&nbsp;nostalgia.</p>
<p>Central to making an aesthetically appealing polar chart is making the animation smooth. This might be doable through various esoteric <span class="caps">CSS</span> transforms, but I’m not particularly knowledgeable in that area, and I’m not a huge fan of crafting elaborate animations with CSS. It lacks a certain amount of control (which manually updating and redrawing affords) and tends to feel extremely sluggish on computers which lack extremely modern graphics cards (such as mine). Since things like uploading a file involves a lot of guesswork and various aspects of the upload process are very much stochastic (ie. waiting for the server to respond), the smoothing system needs to be able to create a nice smooth animation out of highly erratic information. But it also needs to simultaneously relay information without having an excessive amount of&nbsp;lag.</p>
<p>In order to strike a sort of balance, it uses an interpolation algorithm which was employed in Steve Wittens’<a href="http://acko.net/blog/js1k-demo-the-making-of/"> js1k entry</a> and you can see <a href="https://gist.github.com/2236530">my code</a> here. In order to minimize the <span class="caps">CPU</span> tax of running such an animation, it uses the HTML5 requestAnimationFrame function. This has the nice side effect that when you leave it uploading in the background for a while, it automatically stops updating the animation and quickly slides into position when you&nbsp;return.</p>
<p>There are two rings, the outer one being dark gray and the inner one being a somewhat lighter shade of gray (fitting into the mostly unsaturated theme of the interface). The outer ring represents the total upload progress while the inner ring represents the progress of an individual file. The outer ring “spins” in a sense, in a clockwise manner while the inner ring rotates in the opposite direction. Every time a ring completes a revolution, it “inverts”, for instance, when the outer ring fills up and becomes a solid circle, the ring begins to open from the opposite direction so that the imaginary end of the rotation continues unimpeded. The animation is somewhat difficult to describe in words so here’s a <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1024307/musicalpha/animation.html">demo of the progress animation</a>.</p>
<p>When the page first loads, the polar plot exists in the background, behind the prominent logo. It represents the song quota, the percentage out of the 20,000 song quota which Google Music&nbsp;imposes.</p>
<p>While implementing the algorithm, I had a little trouble because of <span class="caps">SSL</span> certificates. The domain which accepts all the protobufs encoded information has a certificate signed for the wrong domain, and browsers have a tendency to care a lot about certificate validity. To get around it, those requests are proxied by a simple server which is made with Google App Engine. All communication with that server itself is signed as well, and it doesn’t do any&nbsp;logging.</p>
<p>When I was about to publish this post and first announced that it works again, there was a bit of trouble which people had getting it to work. This was actually because Google Music allows each <span class="caps">MAC</span> address to be associated with a few accounts but forbids any additional accounts. The first released version would use a single mac address for all clients, but it has since been replaced with a sort of unique identifier which is stored in&nbsp;localStorage.</p>
<p>Apparently a<a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2012/03/upcoming-google-music-features.html"> browser based uploade</a>r may be something coming soon to Google Music. Enjoy<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/obojocfchdgdpgcigcdhdnlakfcbbgfn"> this app</a> while it&nbsp;lasts.</p>

            </header>
            <section class="content"><p><a href="/articles/2011/Surplus%204/Screenshot-at-2011-10-28-213821.png"><div class="pic md" style="" ><img src="/articles/2011/Surplus%204/Screenshot-at-2011-10-28-213821.png" alt="" ><div class="caption">Blurry</div></div></a></p>
<p>Recently Surplus stopped working. Well, it hasn’t been working for a lot of people for a long time already, but that’s besides the point. It stopped working entirely. Surplus has always been a rather fragile creature. It operates like a kid on a high speed scooter attempting to carry a house of cards between two strangers. That house of cards is part of a delicate system of frames inside frames inside frames inside frames that move between frames. Surplus is this fairly atrocious mess of&nbsp;frames.</p>
<p>Framing things works out fine until you discover that whatever you’re framing is trying to break out. Meet the X-Frame-Options header, the source Surplus’s recent predicament. It has well meaning motives: to prevent Google from suffering from evil attacks like Clickjacking, <span class="caps">XSRF</span> and other nasty things. Incidentally, security-wise, Surplus would probably belong closer to something of that nature than a legitimate application. It doesn’t use an API because applications generally wouldn’t find it&nbsp;useful.</p>
<p>Recently, all Google properties started including that X-Frame-Options header, and now can’t be embedded in frames. It wasn’t an absolutely unprecedented move, because just a few weeks earlier Google Video had started sending out the header (which led to an update which moved from a Google Video host frame). But now it was across all Google Sites, and there was no short term hack that could be&nbsp;done.</p>
<p>The solution was to take a random Google page which didn’t send out the header and mimic all the postMessage messages that are sent from the Google Plus notifications frame. Consequently, the entire frame signaling and attachment system had to be rewritten, and that system was so deeply tied into everything else that Surplus 4 ended up being almost an entire rewrite (the inner frame actions, the options page and the notifications parser did not&nbsp;change).</p>

<p>Even more impressive, the name, which is a fairly common word is actually on the first page of a Google search for the word (around eighth result). It peaked at around 53,000 users and at one point made me the 329th most followed person on&nbsp;Google+.</p>

            <section class="content"><p><em>Note: I’ve changed a few things that will hopefully make my point a bit more&nbsp;clear</em></p>
<p>Apple got it right in&nbsp;2007.</p>
<p>If you’ve read any of the other posts in this blog, you will probably come under the assumption that I’m a devout follower of the Church of Google. Thus it will probably be quite a surprise to read the headline, something which appears downright sacrilegious: it questions the infallibility of the great Google. But I try very hard to maintain some semblance of objectivity and rationality, and this post will be about why I think the Chrome Web Store is bad for the&nbsp;web.</p>
<p>The Chrome Web Store is the applications and extensions gallery for Chrome. It’s Google’s centralized repository and directory for discovering Chrome-related things. Just hearing the name of it, you can probably tell, it’s likely quite inspired by the iOS/iTunes/Mac App Store. It’s not because they aren’t able to innovate (or it might, but I won’t take that view), but it’s probably the result of the huge App Store boom. It’s not that even what Apple did was particularly innovative, but somehow it managed to secure billions of dollars for the company, and all it’s competitors quite rationally want a chunk of it. This however, isn’t about improving the state and future of the web, but rather the indulgence of buzzwords.  This post isn’t only about the Web Store, but rather the entire Chrome Applications and Extensions systems. From distribution to installation and the user experience&nbsp;afterwards.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-">Introduction.</h2>
<p>There are two types of installable web applications that exist in the Chrome Web Store: hosted apps, in other words “glorified bookmarks”, and packaged apps. Glorified bookmarks are relatively hard to create, expensive and have no real additional functionality. Packaged applications evade the standardized mechanisms for offline web properties and eliminates many of the advantages of web apps in the first&nbsp;place.</p>
<p>Chrome’s developer overview for creating installable web apps describes the system as a solution to one, rather insignificant, problem. It’s the problem of permissions escalation: some technical detail that hardly seems important. Put simply, it’s that users get annoyed when they’re asked to hit “Okay” to annoying permissions prompts. And so Google’s solution is to invent a certain class of web site which has different security properties, where all the permissions are put into a single&nbsp;prompt.</p>
<p>To users, however, the existence of a web app is a solution to a much different user experience problem: they want to hit nice large pretty icons to go to sites which they frequently visit. But somehow, the solution they opted for creating these large clickable bookmarks is quite terrible. The only user-facing purpose of installable applications is the ability to bookmark with a large icon, something that Apple got right with iPhone <span class="caps">OS</span> in&nbsp;2007.</p>
<h2 id="apple-got-it-right-">Apple got it&nbsp;right.</h2>
<p>I love those four words in that order, it feels so sensationalist and rebellious. But before the Cult of Apple leaps on that statement, notice the wording “Apple <em>got</em> it right”. It doesn’t strictly mean that whatever Apple’s doing <em>now</em> is right, just that what it <em>did</em> is right. In fact, that’s exactly what happened. Apple got it right, then made it different, and Google made it&nbsp;wrong.</p>
<p>First, we need to recall the distant year of 2007. It was quite a while ago, and I won’t pretend that my memory is that great. But it was a long time ago, a full year before the first beta release of Google Chrome. The iPhone was released with it’s plethora of eight apps and no ability to install more. The App Store didn’t exist, and the closest semblance was the Installer.app for jailbroken devices (Cydia came later).  A few months later, Apple released a series of updates, and Steve Jobs signaled what he believed to be the future of iPhone applications: The Web. It doesn’t come surprising that Apple’s Mobile Safari was and likely still is (more or less) the best browser for any mobile&nbsp;device.</p>
<p>The important aspect is the <em>way</em> these web applications were installed. You went to Mobile Safari, and browsed around. You found a web app, and you used the web app the <em>way the web was intended</em>. No installations, you just navigate to a <span class="caps">URL</span> and start using it. You find the app useful and/or awesome, and you “bookmark” it.  But, instead of actually doing the browser “bookmark”, you hit the button right below: “Add to Home Screen”. It asks you for a name for that application, automatically prepopulated with the document page title. You hit “Add”, and you now have a nice, shiny icon on your home screen. You can hide the browser chrome and it becomes indistinguishable from the normal native application&nbsp;experience.</p>
<p>That app icon is just an image <span class="caps">URL</span> specified with a single meta tag. It’s totally decentralized in every way, and represents the openness and simplicity that simply <em>makes sense</em> for this platform. All a developer needs to do to enable their web site to turn into a fully fledged web application is to add a <code>&lt;link rel=&quot;apple-touch-icon&quot; href=&quot;/customIcon.png&quot;/&gt;</code> in the head section of the&nbsp;page.</p>
<p>Contrast that with what Google requires: creating a Google checkout account, entering credit card information, navigating to the Chrome Web Store page and clicking several links in the footer in order to navigate to the page where you have to pay $5 for creating an app, create several icons, copy the manifest.json template and editing some values pointing to the icon locations, going to chrome://extensions, enabling developer mode, adding the unpacked app to make sure that it works, then going back to the original directory, zipping it up, and uploading it to the Chrome Web store, where you have to write a description, add screenshots, reupload an icon, publish, wait ten minutes, and then spam the internet with that link and edit your site’s code to point to that page. It’s an awful much to go through in order to <em>just create a bookmark</em>.</p>
<h2 id="apple-turns-evil-">Apple turns&nbsp;evil.</h2>
<p>This subtitle is intentionally misleading. I don’t really think Apple’s evil, but that loaded four letter word is much more concise than the more appropriate phrase “Apple adopts a new platform and shifts ideologically to favor a system which is ultimately in conflict with and entirely inapplicable to the web in its current state or in the foreseeable&nbsp;future”.</p>
<p>Apple’s prescience of the power of the web was sadly a bit anachronistic. The web technologies that would enable their vision <em>were not yet ready</em>. The second browser wars haven’t really even begun, and the jailbreakers, despite handicaps, still managed to develop that platform more than the officially sanctioned web developers could. Browsers were too slow, hardware was to slow, there weren’t enough features, not enough could be done, and the paradigm was not well&nbsp;understood.</p>
<p>Apple followed the lead set by the jailbreak community and launched their own native application development and distribution system: The App Store. It was a hit, and soon became a super huge buzzword. It an all that it represented: centralized one click micropayment driven mobile advertising funded indie developer weekend novelty&nbsp;apps.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Google gets it&nbsp;wrong.</span></p>
<p>So there was an App Store craze, and everyone wanted one. So it logically follows that Google built an App Store. But the web had no notion of <em>apps</em>. There were web applications, but they weren’t rigidly defined as apps.  This is where Google got it wrong. The Chrome Web Store needed to sell apps, and had to create a dichotomy out of the web in order to do so. It created a distinction between web apps and websites where none had existed and shouldn’t have ever&nbsp;existed.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">The false&nbsp;dichotomy.</span></p>
<p>Steve Jobs said that on Mobile, people want Apps, not websites. Before blindly mimicking the concept of apps on another platform, one should probably explore <em>why</em> users like apps over websites. It’s because the mobile app offers a _better mobile-optimized _interface to whatever they’re&nbsp;doing.</p>
<p>Websites aren’t generally designed for mobile, they are often slower, and can’t make use of persistent user interface elements like a tab bar. Apps aren’t popular because of the existence of the App Store. It’s because there’s additional value provided in having those apps, that users use the App Store to get&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>However, web apps, just like websites are optimized for normal computers. Web apps are no better than web sites, and when web apps really have nothing to provide, their respective web stores are&nbsp;useless.</p>
<p>One purported reason for creating the distinction between apps and websites is to give developers the opportunity to charge for the application in the web store. But why should the ability for an author to receive money for his or her respective works be exclusive to web apps? Why not all web&nbsp;sites?</p>
<p>While it’s quite clear that if anything meant to supplant a desktop application and is built for the web can be considered a “web app”, nearly everything else exists in a sort of gray area. Facebook, Twitter and the other social networking are predominately content focused, but have some app-like characteristics, and so they could be considered “web apps” too, despite how there aren’t really desktop equivalents. But what about sites like the New York Times? Pure content sites would logically seem to be the farthest one can go from the concept of an “application”. It’s clear that <em>any</em> web site can be considered a web&nbsp;app.</p>
<p>Since anything can be considered a web app, the Web Store is a mere directory of a certain number of websites. It’s a limited subset of the internet with terrible discoverability properties restricted only to sites where the owner (or a particularly devout fan) is willing to pay $5 in order to allow a subset of users to <em>bookmark the site</em>. It’s proprietary, no other site can have quite the same properties as <em>the</em> web store because Google has the Web Store URLs hard coded into chrome somewhere. Searching in the web store really isn’t that great either, with no ability to search reviews, no pagerank, no search operators, no ability to search within the content of apps. You would figure that if Google were to clone a subset of the internet, at least they would get search&nbsp;right.</p>
<p>This closed, exclusive and excessively tedious process for creating mere bookmarks attacks some of the web’s traditional benefits and&nbsp;ideals.</p>
<h2 id="packaged-applications-">Packaged&nbsp;applications.</h2>
<p>The above sections dealt with how the “glorified bookmarks” are useless and downright harmful. There is a second class of applications which are similar to the former in that they also get a pretty large prominent and clickable icon, but different in that they actually provide functionality that is different from mere ordinary websites. Its virtues include that they tend to work offline and have the ability to do certain things that normal web apps can not do. However, it pretty much stops&nbsp;there.</p>
<p>Packaged apps work offline, but their mechanism evades the standardized system of <span class="caps">HTML5</span>. Rather than promoting the use of standards, they promote the use of a proprietary and nonstandard signed zip&nbsp;package.</p>
<p>As they’re “packaged”, they aren’t really “true” web apps, because they don’t actually operate in the scope of the web. They are much closer to desktop apps, practically. They have no URLs, and thus can’t be linked to, evading the very first two letters in <span class="caps">HTML</span> and HTTP: “HyperText”. One of the greatest things about web sites is that they can be linked to, and they almost always share that universal identifier to share with people. It’s universally accessible and one of the few things that actually enables intra-site&nbsp;interoperability.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-">Conclusion.</h2>
<p>While the “glorified bookmark” class of applications, which make up the vast majority of the Chrome Web Store, can be quite easily fixed by implementing something akin to the iPhone <span class="caps">OS</span> home screen web apps, the “packaged applications” are a bit more interesting. They are the source of that problem which the applications system was meant to resolve: permissions. In the current state, there is no system for handling multiple permissions on the web, aside from flooding the screen with infobars, when even that only partially works. What the web needs is a user friendly, informative, and useful system for giving additional permissions to web&nbsp;sites.</p>
<p>Along with that, the Web Store handles the selling of applications. Accepting money is a two part process, consisting of authentication and payment. Browsers should handle user identity, since they have the resources to do it right, in a nuanced, secure, efficient and user friendly way. Once that’s done, payment would be a logical extension to that. A developer could drop in a Google Checkout widget to have one-click in-app-purchases by tying into the secure browser identity&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>The Chrome Web Store should be reduced to a community maintained directory of useful web applications, something like a wiki, and there shouldn’t be a $5 fee to add&nbsp;applications.</p>
<p>Some people have expressed the idea that the Chrome Web Store is useful because it allows Google, a trusted party, to take down dangerous or malicious applications quickly. And while this is true, note that the Web Store is not actually the sole means to install chrome applications, and a malicious party would most likely exploit those alternate channels, and the only way to combat those is to institute a sort of Kill Switch, much like the kind that iOS, Kindle, and Android already&nbsp;implement.</p>

<p>Google Music Beta is a pretty cool web app, but the Music Manager sadly only works on Windows and Mac. As a Linux user who unfortunately feels neglected by the service, but still appreciative of being invited to the service a mere day after it’s announcement, I decided to do something to remedy the situation. Not to mention the irony that one can’t even upload music to the service from Google’s own Chrome <span class="caps">OS</span>. So <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/obojocfchdgdpgcigcdhdnlakfcbbgfn">MusicAlpha</a> was&nbsp;born.</p>
<p>This project was a pretty interesting hack, so I guess I’ll try to document the process of how I made it and how it currently works. And also, for any prospective filmmakers, this story might make for an interesting abstract action movie. But for any of you who just want to install the app, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/obojocfchdgdpgcigcdhdnlakfcbbgfn">click here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="inception">Inception</h2>
<p>I started this only days after finishing the new revision of Cloud Save, the extension that I never quite understood, but everyone else seemed to get. One part of the newest revision was adding support for Amazon’s Cloud Drive service, which does not have an established <span class="caps">API</span>. However, the interactions between the javascript web interface and the server are pretty simple to understand, thanks to the almighty web inspector. The only weird thing was that the actual file upload was actually conducted through Flash, which felt unnecessary but it wasn’t an insurmountable task. But it was all built on carefully learning the way of the web&nbsp;client.</p>
<p>There was one feature request for Cloud Save to enable saving to Google Music, and that’s when the idea sort of&nbsp;started.</p>
<p>The first step was to get a Google Music account, nothing surprising there. A few hours after the announcement was the first opportunity for me to access a computer, and also when I hit the “request invite” button. In a shockingly short amount of time of a mere day, I received a nice email saying that I had been invited to the service. Yay. Now the letdown of not being able to upload from Linux begins, as well as the scheming to reverse engineer&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>A few months ago, I had the idea to do something similar, but with another Google product: Google Goggles. But after hooking up the anrdoid simulator with a http proxy (Charles), and looking at the results. I was rather dismayed, but not particularly surprised by the results: all the communication was encoded using Protobuf. Protobuf, or Protocol Buffers is “Google’s data interchange format”, according to it’s Google Code project page. It’s a structured system for encoding binary data where a .proto template is already known and compiled. Protobufs are bad in much the same way minification is. There are totally justifiable reasons to minify source code, but the elimination of a useful View Source detracts from the open ideal of the web. Though protocol buffers aren’t encrypted, they are not comprehensible without a .proto file to decode them. With a lot of work, one might be able to reverse engineer a .proto file, but it’s certainly much harder than a <span class="caps">JSON</span>&nbsp;protocol.</p>
<p>Before I began, this was the worst fear. That everything as encoded with protocol buffers, and my attempts to mimic it would be rendered&nbsp;futile.</p>
<h2 id="packets">Packets</h2>
<p>I borrowed a computer which ran Windows 7, and installed the Music Manager in hopes of deciphering the secret enigma of the great google. I needed a simple packet sniffer, and so I used nirsoft’s smartsniff. I didn’t use wireshark because it wasn’t my computer, and I didn’t want to install and download a huge app with an intimidating user interface. Smartsniff worked pretty well, and I thought I was almost there. Packet sniffers generally can’t decode https data without some <span class="caps">MITM</span>-esque certificate faking, and I have reason to believe that that wouldn’t work either since running the strings command on the MusicManager.exe file includes something that resembles a public&nbsp;key.</p>
<p>Anyway, I found two raw unencrypted <span class="caps">HTTP</span> requests, and sort of fixated myself on those&nbsp;two.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="caps">POST</span> /uploadsj/rupio&nbsp;HTTP/1.1</p>
<p>User-Agent: Music Manager (1, 0, 12, 3443 -&nbsp;Windows)</p>
<p>Host:&nbsp;uploadsj.clients.google.com</p>
<p>Accept: <em>/</em></p>
<p>Cookie: <span class="caps">SID</span>=[redacted] domain=.google.com&nbsp;path=/</p>
<p>Expect:&nbsp;None</p>
<p>Content-Length:&nbsp;851</p>
<p>Content-Type:&nbsp;application/x-www-form-urlencoded</p>
<p>{“clientId”:”Jumper&nbsp;Uploader”,”createSessionRequest”:{“fields”:[{“inlined”:{“content”:”jumper-uploader-title-19Redacted”,”contentType”:”text/plain”,”name”:”title”}},</p>
<p>{“external”:{“filename”:”Redacted.mp3”,”name”:”C:\Users\Redacted.mp3”,”put”:{},”size”:610Redacted}},</p>
<p>{“inlined”:{“content”:”0”,”name”:”AlbumArtLength”}},</p>
<p>{“inlined”:{“content”:”0”,”name”:”AlbumArtStart”}},</p>
<p>{“inlined”:{“content”:”3rBe9dCa%c2tBeJdD”,”name”:”ClientId”}},</p>
<p>{“inlined”:{“content”:”00:1F:R3:<span class="caps">DA</span>:C7:ED”,”name”:”MachineIdentifier”}},</p>
<p>{“inlined”:{“content”:”5a5de21sd-54dsfe-Redacted”,”name”:”ServerId”}},</p>
<p>{“inlined”:{“content”:”true”,”name”:”SyncNow”}},</p>
<p>{“inlined”:{“content”:”153”,”name”:”TrackBitRate”}},</p>
<p>{“inlined”:{“content”:”false”,”name”:”TrackDoNotRematch”}}</p>
<p>]},”protocolVersion”:”0.8”}
I noticed the second request was rather huge, <span class="caps">3556KB</span>. Just enough to fit a normal-sized MP3. I knew what was in there.
PUT /uploadsj/rupio?upload_id=REDACTED&amp;file_id=000&nbsp;HTTP/1.1</p>
<p>User-Agent: Music Manager (1, 0, 12, 3443 -&nbsp;Windows)</p>
<p>Host:&nbsp;uploadsj.clients.google.com</p>
<p>Accept: <em>/</em></p>
<p>Cookie: <span class="caps">SID</span>=REDACTED domain=.google.com&nbsp;path=/</p>
<p>Content-Type:&nbsp;audio/mpeg</p>
<p>Expect:&nbsp;None</p>
<p>Content-Length:&nbsp;<span class="caps">3141REDACTED</span></p>
<p><span class="caps">ID3</span>…..%vTENC….@..WXXX……..TIT2……. Redacted
At this point, I was relatively ecstatic. Or at least, I will pretend that I was, because everything looked elegantly and remarkably simple. I had no idea where the upload_id came from, but I figured that it was part of the response from the first POST request. Part of the problem was that SmartSniff didn’t give me the actual responses to the HTTP requests, only the request data. Or at least from the five minutes that I bothered using it. The cookie looked like a generic cookie that would exist in a normal browser&nbsp;session.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="prototype">Prototype</h2>
<p>Since it used generic browser cookies, the simplest way to start would be to make a browser extension. Specifically, a Chrome App. That way, I could get the necessary permissions to do all the cross domain security protocol violations and probe around a bunch of requests. Since XHRs already include cookies for a specific domain, there’s nothing I need to do to set the cookies. I hoped and suspected that the User-Agent, Accept, and Expect headers were basically ignored, and the content-type would be rather trivial to&nbsp;set.</p>
<p>A lesson in premature optimization was the huge block of <span class="caps">JSON</span> which got sent with the first POST request. I had no idea what was really essential, so basically, I just deleted almost everything there except for what I thought might be really important: the file name and size. There were no errors in the POST request, so I figured it was okay to delete all of that stuff. I ran the POST and just as I suspected, the JSON that resulted included the upload_id, in fact, it included the entire PUT url, which was pretty&nbsp;nice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>{“sessionStatus”:{“state”:”<span class="caps">OPEN</span>”,”externalFieldTransfers”:[{“name”:”REDACTED.mp3”,”status”:”IN_PROGRESS”,”bytesTransferred”:0,”bytesTotal”:314REDACTED,”putInfo”:{“url”:”<a href="http://uploadsj.clients.google.com/uploadsj/rupio?upload_id=AEdREDACTED&amp;file_id=000&quot;},&quot;content_type&quot;:&quot;audio/mpeg&quot;}],&quot;upload_id&quot;:&quot;AEdREDACTED&quot;}}">http://uploadsj.clients.google.com/uploadsj/rupio?upload_id=AEdREDACTED&amp;file_id=000&quot;},&quot;content_type&quot;:&quot;audio/mpeg&quot;}],&quot;upload_id&quot;:&quot;AEdREDACTED&quot;}}</a>
Then, when I executed the subsequent <span class="caps">PUT</span> request. I was scared.
{“errorMessage”:{“reason”:”REQUEST_REJECTED”,”additionalInfo”:{“uploader_service.GoogleRupioAdditionalInfo”:{“completionInfo”:{“status”:”REJECTED”,”customerSpecificInfo”:{“ResponseCode”:404}},”requestRejectedInfo”:{“reasonDescription”:”agent_rejected”}}},”upload_id”:”AEdREDACTED”}}
Scary. The rejection reason was “agent_rejected”, which made me think about the User-Agent header, and I wondered if that was supposed to matter. If that did matter, then I would have to prototype it in a different language since XMLHttpRequests forbid the setting of the User-Agent and other headers for security reasons (even operating in a privledged&nbsp;environment!).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But thankfully, before attempting the drastic route, I pasted back in the alleged cruft, the jumper-uploader-title, TrackDoNotRematch, TrackBitRate, SyncNow, ServerId, MachineIdentifier, ClientID, AlbumArtStart (hey that rhymes!), and AlbumArtLength. Magically now, it worked.&nbsp;Yay.</p>
<h2 id="rupio">Rupio</h2>
<p>During my quest to understand the bizarre agent_rejected error (because I totally fear rejection, they should have used a nicer word), I tried googling GoogleRupioAdditionalInfo. (I had googled “Rupio” before, since that was part of the <span class="caps">POST</span> url, but that didn’t yield any relevant results, it just ended up being a bunch of people’s names). Searching GoogleRupioAdditionalInfo yielded a more limited subset which happened to be more&nbsp;interesting.</p>
<p>The first result, from the SMEStorage Blog described an error emitted by the Google Docs platform. The next result was on the Picasa help forums, about “Upload video results in Error”. Then was a french language forum which mentioned an error which included GoogleRupioAdditionalInfo, this time on the url&nbsp;“upload.youtube.com”.</p>
<p>So, it seems “Rupio” is the codename (or just the name, but it’s much more fun imagining that there are subliminal codes everywhere) of a unified Google data upload/storage platform. That’s pretty cool. It probably makes sense that they have a sort of unified file storage system across Google Docs, Picasa, and Youtube, since it would probably be easier to maintain a system which is internally consistent. But to inject a sensationalist twist where occam’s razor shows that it’s not justified, this is a hint at an upcoming unified Google file storage service. A sort of file-browser dashboard which links all media and document files together in an accessible and uniform&nbsp;manner.</p>
<h2 id="shiny">Shiny</h2>
<p>It worked. Or at least, it seemed to work. Vaguely. At this point, I was reasonably satisfied and began sculpting a nice pretty interface for it. Following my usual way, I just stole the Tango icon for an audio file mime type and built the entire interface around it. I remembered that earlier that day, I had discovered something called Layer Styles, which is a photoshop gradient/style clone that instead generates <span class="caps">CSS3</span> gradients. I thought that was cool and I remembered it, so I played around with it and made a centered rectangle. Gray on&nbsp;Gray.</p>
<p>I decided on a name for it: MusicAlpha. It’s a sort of play on how this Google product features Beta in a way which is much more prominently than usual, with the gray “beta” the same size as the actual “music”. The Alpha sort of says something about how it will almost eternally be stuck in this unstable and incomplete form. It also reminded me of one of my favorite websites: wolfram alpha, and how the logo is stylized WolframAlpha or&nbsp;Wolfram|Alpha.</p>
<p>I wanted it to be minimal, but I’ve since adopted the belief that drag-and-drop file selection was only a fad. Sure, it’s often really useful, but it’s not great to restrict to that. A hybrid approach is much better, and if you have to have only one, then the standard browse button is better since you can drag and drop files to that button (on chrome, anyway) without any special code. Drag and Drop is often quite terrible on laptops, and I’m not sure if you can even drag and drop files with Chrome <span class="caps">OS</span>, since the file browser might be&nbsp;modal.</p>
<p>There’s not much to the interface, it’s probably as minimal as it can get. Two links, one to the service, the other to me. A button. That’s&nbsp;it.</p>
<h2 id="dismay">Dismay</h2>
<p>At some point in every good story (not implying that this is a good story), there’s false hope, where the protagonist (not implying that I’m the protagonist here, either) believes that he or she (not implying that I’m a she) is closer to the end than is factually warranted (I’m actually implying that that’s exactly what happened). I checked the Google Music song list, and lo and behold, the song was&nbsp;there.</p>
<p>Sort of. Not really.<em> Something</em> was. Not sure it was a&nbsp;song.</p>
<p><a href="/articles/2011/MusicAlpha%20Upload%20to%20Google%20Music%20Beta%20from%20Linux%20and%20Chrome%20OS/Screenshot1.png"><div class="pic md" style="" ><img src="/articles/2011/MusicAlpha%20Upload%20to%20Google%20Music%20Beta%20from%20Linux%20and%20Chrome%20OS/Screenshot1-300x60.png" alt="" ><div class="caption">Screenshot</div></div></a></p>
<p>There was a blank row. Double click it, and something does play. And it is the song. But, there’s no way to seek because incidentally, it doesn’t know how long the track is, so there’s no way to render the position of the&nbsp;song.</p>
<p>It was late, and this was frustrating, so I just posted a terse blog post announcing the beginning of the&nbsp;project:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So pretty soon, I hacked together something that almost sort of worked, with one rather significant caveat: It doesn’t pick up any tag data, name, time, artist, album, etc. I can’t figure out why. I guess I’ll try some more tomorrow.
And by the way, I totally lied. I didn’t try at all the next&nbsp;day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yesterday, that is, May 13th, the delightful Friday the Thirteenth, I tried again. I installed Music Manager on a VMWare installation of Windows <span class="caps">XP</span>, and sniffed the traffic with Wireshark running on the host computer. Didn’t notice anything new in the plethora of data which happened to get exchanged. I tried running smartsniff from the VM, but every time I tried to start sniffing, VMWare magically&nbsp;crashed.</p>
<h2 id="skyjam">SkyJam</h2>
<p>At this point, I thought of looking at the MusicManager.exe binary. Usually, binaries have some random strings in them, which you can look at to give some hint at what it does, without actually decompiling something. I’m now going to proceed to anachronistically mention something about android, because of a certain <span class="caps">URL</span> that I find out later in this chronology: android.clients.google.com. So I used strings MusicManager.exe | grep android, and found some rather interesting&nbsp;things</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2-.wireless_android_skyjam.CopyrightStatus.Type</p>
<p>2”.wireless_android_skyjam.ProductId</p>
<p>wireless_android_skyjam.Uits</p>
<p>Metadata.ParentalAdvisoryType
There appears to be 214 mentions of the phrase “skyjam” in the executable, which I assume is not some new solar powered Google sandwich filling distribution mechanism powered by artificial intelligence driven aeronautically mobile condiment dispensers (obviously using&nbsp;Arduinos).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have no idea what Skyjam is, but that’s totally a much cooler name than Google Music, regardless of how big you write “beta”. And what’s wireless_android_skyjam? Why is skyjam so deeply tied with wireless and android? Maybe it’s got something to do with flying robot sandwich machines. Or&nbsp;not.</p>
<p>Maybe it has something to do with that Simplify Media company which Google bought last year. Or maybe I’m just a little sad that the product ended. According to&nbsp;TechCrunch,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google <span class="caps">VP</span> Vic Gundotra said that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/20/um-did-google-just-quietly-launch-a-web-based-itunes-competitor-yep/#ixzz0oUJBJO3l">Simplify’s technology</a> will be used to offer a desktop app that will give you access to all of your (<span class="caps">DRM</span>-free) media on your Android devices remotely, using Google’s new iTunes competitor on the&nbsp;web.</p>
<p>&gt;
Desktop App: Check. Android: Check. New iTunes Competitor on the Web: Check. Simplify’s Technology: Not so&nbsp;much.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those who aren’t familiar with what Simplify did (which I assume is nigh everyone), it streamed your music by making your desktop into something of a server, so your huge cache of music can be accessible by any mobile device&nbsp;remotely.</p>
<h2 id="fishtank">Fishtank</h2>
<p>I had a random false lead. I thought that the server still read <span class="caps">ID3</span> data on itself, and noticed that the HTTP dump was somehow slightly different from the original file. It was the same length. The exact same length, but some of the bytes were different. Most were the same, and they were all in the same place, but for example, all 0x00’s seemed to have been swapped with 0xe4’s. Some other bytes were also different, and in retrospect this was probably because the program which created the http dump sucked and encoded all the bytes wrong or something. But I tried opening it up in Ghex and I swapped every 0xe4 with a 0x00, and magically the broken file now played, with one exception: the audio now sounded like a fishtank. It’s like everything’s just water, magestically moving around with exquisite&nbsp;sublimity.</p>
<h2 id="sniffing">Sniffing</h2>
<p>I borrowed another Windows computer this time, and tried again. This time, I also tried the <span class="caps">HTTP</span> Proxy called Fiddler, which seemed to be able to capture more information, or at least give me more of the information that I would find useful and less of what I wouldn’t find useful. I noticed that for every file which was uploaded, there were in fact three requests, not two as I had previously&nbsp;observed.</p>
<p>So where had this covert <span class="caps">HTTP</span> request been hiding? Behind in the magical realm of HTTPS/TLS encryption. I couldn’t peek into the actual content of the HTTPS requests because of the fact it was encrypted. And as the strings command had revealed earlier, there was a huge block of base64 encoded text which appeared to look like a sort of public key. It suddenly connected, the Music Manager probably has its own list of trusted certificate authorities, and that’s why adding a mere certificate to Windows wouldn’t do a&nbsp;thing.</p>
<p>But the unencrypted <span class="caps">CONNECT</span> request, which initiates a HTTPS connection said&nbsp;enough.</p>
<p>There was a request to android.clients.google.com and it was encoded with gasp: application/x-protobufs. If this was some sort of action movie, here would be the scene where the antagonist from the previous movie reveals that he is still alive (with some facial scarring) and the person responsible for all the disappearing bodies (of&nbsp;data).</p>
<p>I was about to give up at this point, but then a new idea&nbsp;sturck.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-hope">A New&nbsp;Hope</h2>
<p>This is the second movie-title article sub-title that I’m aware of, unless there’s a movie called “Packet Sniffing”. For the prospective filmmaker, this is when the protagonist has the flashback and remembers that time, long long ago (though here it’s only like four days, you can take creative liberties), when refining the art of hackery, a task involved crafting an implementation of a storage system from the web interface of a specific cloud drive&nbsp;service.</p>
<p>So, I noticed that I had spent so much time exploring what enigma lay beyond the surface of Google Music, that I totally forgot to actually use the service. And when I did, I realized that there was an Edit Song Info context button. Trying the feature out, it seems to be a simple <span class="caps">JSON</span> post to a certain modifyentries&nbsp;URL.</p>

Amazing. I just stumbled on the magical code which would allow me to finish the project. Yay. Now I had to figure out what the xt= parameter means (after determining it’s necessity). My first hunch was to search the <span class="caps">HTML</span> source of the page, because the magical access codes for Amazon Cloud Drive were put inside a hidden input element. But no, it wasn’t there. Now the fear starts settling in, what if it’s a strategically computed magical super string? But why would they ever do&nbsp;that?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Somehow I noticed somewhere on every time the page is loaded, the network logs indicate a Set-Cookie: xt=<span class="caps">AM</span>-REDACTED. Now I knew how to get it: Just send an XHR to the cloud player and copy the&nbsp;cookie.</p>
<h2 id="serverid">ServerID</h2>
<p>Now, the important pat of all the items in the entries object is probably the id. Everything else seems somewhat generic, and probably exists for any song that you throw at the service, but id clearly has a definite, important, non-random, predetermined value. I thought that there was no correlation between the data passed from the uploaded data and the id which was here, since the upload_id was way too long and had nothing in common with this song&nbsp;id.</p>
<p>Since the songs that get uploaded have no title, they always appear first on the alphabetical list of songs, so I figured I would just pull a list of the songs, alphabetically, and then take the first one to get the <span class="caps">ID</span>. Then I discovered the auto-playlists, which included one for most recently&nbsp;added.</p>
<p>Unless you have the power of omniscience, you don’t know that the format of the IDs here were like das8f7-adf0w8f-adf87we-mwere, because I slapped a huge <span class="caps">REDACTED</span> on the latter half. The random string generating code that I’ve used for years out of convenience is Math.random().toString(36).substr(2), which basically generates a random float, converts the fractional part to base 36 (0-9 a-z) and strips the leading “0.” from the string. This incidentally ends up being quite short (especially on chrome, it’s much longer on firefox), and lacks the&nbsp;dashes.</p>
<p>So I looked at the <span class="caps">ID</span> for one of the streams and noticed that the id string was unusually short. I started wondering why something like that would happen, and then it struck me, not quite like lightning because I’m still alive (though whether or not I am when you’re reading this is a totally different question). This file ID was the same thing as the ServerID which I thought was just a random useless value that was arbitrarily required for it to work. I deleted the whole getRecent routine and suddenly everything started to make&nbsp;sense.</p>
<h2 id="fish">Fish</h2>
<p>You probably don’t remember my old blog post, almost a year ago, titled A Bright Coloured Fish: Parsing ID3v2 Tags in Javascript and ExtensionFM. Recently, by fate, I happen to have used that code more times that I’m comfortable with, and it seems that once again I must revive this old memory. It’s fairly outdated, and some things are very nasty. Not being able to parse ID3v1 is pretty terrible, though I don’t think I have any songs using&nbsp;v1.</p>
<p>I hoped that Google’s magical server farm would have parsed out the <span class="caps">ID3</span> data, but that doesn’t seem to be the case. I have to manually parse them in the&nbsp;client.</p>
<p>I had to change the id3v2 library a slight bit: the picture parsing code now includes a blob attribute, since the the album art must be uploaded to Google’s servers in order to be included in the&nbsp;metadata.</p>
<p>I guess that fishtank sound was an omen. I’m sure the prospective filmmaker could use it in some way like&nbsp;this.</p>
<h2 id="time">Time</h2>
<p>Rather auspiciously, the modifyentries command included durationMillis. Since it became evident that the music player app had no way of knowing the length of a song without some tag data, that it would be impossible to seek to a certain portion of the song without this ability, it was really important. But since this was from the <span class="caps">API</span> for a user-facing operation, and editing the length of a song isn’t something that a user can or should be able to edit, it was pretty fortunate that that was included as part of the&nbsp;API.</p>
<p>This wasn’t without problems though. It’s not that easy to measure the length of a song. The Length tag of a <span class="caps">MP3</span> file is actually seldom included, so that clearly can’t work. I looked at how to measure the length, and it was pretty scary, since it doesn’t seem like there’s any way other than parsing all the frames out and multiplying the&nbsp;bitrates.</p>
<p>But this time, <span class="caps">HTML5</span> comes to the rescue. I never thought I would be so happy to use . I just take the file, convert it to a blob URL through that nest of if/else statements that handles different versions of chrome. I open it with new Audio and wait for the metadata event, indicating that I now know the length of the song to thirteen places after the decimal. Because of course, I would hate to miss the last picosecond of my&nbsp;song.</p>
<p>I felt sad for the little femtoseconds and attoseconds who were neglected by Google when they decided that the song lengths should be milliseconds. Not quantized divisions of Planck&nbsp;time.</p>
<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>
<p>At this point, nothing interesting really happened. I fixed up the interface, added queueing, and other insignificant things. I published it and spent the rest of day writing a hopelessly long document describing&nbsp;it.</p>
<h2 id="protocol">Protocol</h2>
<p>For those who want to build their own programs which upload to Google Music, I guess I’ll write a summary of how it&nbsp;works.</p>
<ol>
<li>Get Song Metadata (<span class="caps">ID3</span> data, Duration,&nbsp;primarily)</li>
<li>Login to&nbsp;Google</li>
<li><span class="caps">POST</span> to&nbsp;uploadsj.clients.google.com/uploadsj/rupio</li>

<p>So yeah, I just got a Music Beta invite today, and it’s pretty cool except for the fact it doesn’t have any means  of uploading besides the desktop application on Windows and&nbsp;Mac.</p>
<p>So, after a little packet sniffing, I got the basic idea of how it works. You send a <span class="caps">POST</span> to some URL with some info and then that returns a URL that you PUT to in order to add the&nbsp;song.</p>
<p>So pretty soon, I hacked together something that almost sort of worked, with one rather significant caveat: It doesn’t pick up any tag data, name, time, artist, album, etc. I can’t figure out why. I guess I’ll try some more&nbsp;tomorrow.</p>
<p>The prototype is at <a href="https://github.com/antimatter15/musicalpha">https://github.com/antimatter15/musicalpha</a></p>

<p>So, I finally updated my most popular browser extension:<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/omiekjeapoonbhiemenfoccbdpeagdah"> Cloud Save</a>. This adoption has always sort of puzzled me, as it was originally simply a 30 minute hack on drag2up. So I’m trying to be careful not to introduce any huge changes in fear of alienating that magical use case that everyone else seems to have stumbled&nbsp;upon.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, 1.3 introduces lots of useful features. First and foremost is the introduction of a progress bar. I really can’t imagine using it without the progress bar or some other indicator - like how it was in the last version (yet how people still found it useful absolutely bewilders me). The progress dialog is awesome and probably the most significant feature, and after that was just a few backend changes which enabled&nbsp;this.</p>

But I really think it has some potential for differentiating itself from Dropbox in the longer run by integrating some of the functionality of Cloud Save. I guess it’s sort of alluded to by the actual name, a Drive does more than just act as a keep safe for certain intended files, but rather wholly replaces everything. It’s the next logical step for Cloud Save that I certainly can’t take it to, deduplicating all the files on the internet so that online and offline are absolutely&nbsp;seamless.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn’t really want to write a post about yet another chrome extension, as the last five posts have somehow or another related to Google Chrome. Actually, the post I was planning to write before this was “Why the Chrome Webstore is broken”, which would be sort of less fanboy-ish. Anyway, this extension is rather simple, so I’ll probably go into the reasoning as to why I made it, where it might be headed and how I made it. There probably won’t be too much interesting information&nbsp;here.</p>
<p>I wanted a Cr-48. Why? I’m not sure, partially because I don’t actually have a laptop of my own, though my brother’s Macbook Pro (which I’m typing this post on) is pretty awesome. Plus, the platform is new, non-intimidating, more or less open, and there’s such a lack of the most basic tools, that I could probably get a few twitter followers by creating web apps which did things that are really basic yet somehow the web is lacking with. Things like an offline dictionary or wikipedia dump reader. So, Chrome <span class="caps">OS</span> seemed cool, and probably guaranteed bragging rights, at least more so than a Google TV probably would. Due partially to my age, I’m pretty scared of using money and have this feeling that I shouldn’t spend anything on anything more than a can of soda. I guess I’ve gotten off-topic enough, and so, I wanted a Cr-48 (for free, of&nbsp;course).</p>
<p>In my opinion, Google’s pretty good at copying Apple. I don’t mean that in a bad way. I wouldn’t say it’s the intention, but at least they can recognize a good feature and can copy the essence of it in a pretty functional way while for the most part, distancing from the less good parts. Unlike my feelings of what Microsoft would do, which would be to copy most of the bad parts wholesale and add some pretty fascinating and novel parts. So, if any company were to give me a free laptop, that would be awesome, but Apple certainly isn’t going to give things away, and Google’s the only company I think can properly copy the trackpad (though it appears they can’t even do that, from what I’ve&nbsp;read).</p>
<p>So, that’s probably random enough, and you’re wondering how this relates to anything at all. Well, part of my quest to attain a Cr-48 involved building some pretty interesting pieces of software targeted at chrome os (but not by any means exclusive to chrome os). This included the offline dictionary and wikipedia reader. That way, if I didn’t get a Cr-48, I could have an excuse to hate Google and I might be less frequently arguing in their support. But this backup plan failed (fortunately), and I won the LucidChart Cr-48 competition by drawing a picture of a Cr48 out of flow chart&nbsp;components.</p>
<p>I started using Google Groups because I could. I wasn’t spammed by google in the great spamming of some time in february, which means Google hadn’t magically picked for me to have one of those devices (I think this was before I won the LucidChart competition). So I later joined the non-involuntary group for chrome notebook pilots so I could eagerly await the knock on my door from <span class="caps">UPS</span> and be prepared for what to do when that&nbsp;happened.</p>
<p>I skimmed through tons of random posts and eventually I noticed a pattern. People hated the file system and wanted a way to basically get rid of it. The irony is that this new Cloud that is being created, is a static collection of walled gardens. So much for progress. There’s no standard for interoperability and it hasn’t really been too important, but somehow, because of Chrome <span class="caps">OS</span>’s probably bad file system, people are recognizing that that this isn’t right to have an intermediary step to get data from one application to&nbsp;another.</p>
<p>I’ve always held that Browsers are to improve the user experience as much as possible while keeping all of the internet on a balanced and equal platform. I felt that Extensions were the means to trigger change to a specific group of websites or a general heuristic in order to make a more perfect experience. I thought of that while making drag2up, which creates a novel and useful feature which should be used by everybody. As part of building it, I ended up with a sort of <span class="caps">OCD</span> toward creating an implementation of every imaginable file&nbsp;host.</p>
<p>Cloud Save’s heritage is probably as much owed to drag2up as it is to Clip It Good, the latter of which I’ve never actually used, but found it inspiring nonetheless (and I ripped the Picasa implementation out of it too). Clip It Good was the general idea for Cloud Save, except that Cloud Save had more hosts. I made Cloud Save in thirty one minutes and thirty nine seconds, give or take a minute or so. The fact it was made in a mere half hour shows how the idea isn’t novel at all. In fact, most of those minutes were spent setting up the directory structure, manifest, installing inkscape, downloading the tango icon set and unzipping the icons to steal the save action icon (much like how I stole the up arrow icon used as drag2up’s logo). Nearly all of Cloud Save was the code needed to create the context menu. The downloading from <span class="caps">URL</span>, authentication and upload stuff was already in drag2up (I myself was pretty impressed about this. Evidently, I forgot how many features I had put into&nbsp;drag2up.).</p>
<p>Cloud Save wasn’t meant as a sort of glorified bookmark system. Or as a means to politely reshare images without hotlinking. I thought the need was to bypass the physical filesystem. That’s why the application is target primarily toward services which provide a virtual file system: a directory structure, files, privacy, etc. It wasn’t ever really intended as a means to share files, but I guess this is what people want it to do, so I’ll probably make the extension more sharing oriented in the&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>I realized I just forgot the rest of what I was about to write about, so I guess I’ll end it rather abruptly here. This morning, at 11 <span class="caps">AM</span> (though I don’t know if this date has been adjusted for my time zone) when I was still probably in school, Lifehacker posted about it and now people are using it. Awesome. I didn’t expect this to be that&nbsp;significant.</p>

The page doesn’t signal any intent to change the behavior of “Chromium-based browsers”.

<p>So, lets begin with a plead for you to <a href="http://www.lucidchart.com/community/examples/view/4d40ad1f-f1b0-44a7-b39b-1db00ac17bf0">rate my submission (ideally favorably)</a> for the LucidChart chrome notebook contest, partly because it would be awesome, and I need to test the aforementioned <span class="caps">HTML5</span> offline Wikipedia dump&nbsp;reader.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is awesome, and on my service-less iPhone 2G, one of the most useful apps is one with an outdated (by something like three years) Wikipedia dump reader. There’s something very <a href="http://xkcd.com/548/">much like the Hitchhiker’s Guide </a>in carrying the “sum of all human knowledge” in one’s pocket. Wikipedia grows really quickly and the English language dump (as of last month at time of writing) is over six gigs of bzipped&nbsp;<span class="caps">XML</span>.</p>
<p>Another reason for building an offline Wikipedia dump reader is simply that I can. There’s a lot of cool and cutting edge stuff in this. It uses the file input <span class="caps">JS</span> API, FileReader, Blobs, WebWorkers, fast Javascript to handle a pure-JS implementation of the LZMA compression algorithm, and the FileSystem&nbsp;API.</p>
<p><a href="/articles/2011/HTML5%20Offline%20Wikipedia%20Reader%20and%20Help%20me%20win%20a%20Cr-48/Internet-Google-Chrome_002.png"><div class="pic md" style="" ><img src="/articles/2011/HTML5%20Offline%20Wikipedia%20Reader%20and%20Help%20me%20win%20a%20Cr-48/Internet-Google-Chrome_002.png" alt="" ><div class="caption">Internet - Google Chrome_002</div></div></a></p>
<p>All this stuff has only been possible for a very short amount of time. In fact, the FileSystem <span class="caps">API</span> only arrived with the release of Chrome 9 today. It’s pretty awesome to imagine that a web page, HTML and Javascript is processing multiple gigabytes of data at real time. At the current unoptimized state, the search results and the article shows up instantly within 100ms of a key press event (However, I admit it has yet to be tested on the actual English&nbsp;Wikipedia).</p>
<p>This app is almost ideally suited for Chrome <span class="caps">OS</span>. A hundred megabytes worth of data in a month (with the Verizon deal, not to mention that it’s limited to two years) isn’t very much and it would be a pity for the sixteen gigabytes of SSD space on a Cr-48 to be wasted. One of the dumps that I’ve compiled is a subset of the English Wiktionary which makes a great lightweight (8MB) dictionary with over sixty five thousand words. Wiktionary is fairly large at 217MB, and the Simple English Wikipedia is 51MB.
<a href="/articles/2011/HTML5%20Offline%20Wikipedia%20Reader%20and%20Help%20me%20win%20a%20Cr-48/interned-Google-Chrome_004.png"><div class="pic md" style="" ><img src="/articles/2011/HTML5%20Offline%20Wikipedia%20Reader%20and%20Help%20me%20win%20a%20Cr-48/interned-Google-Chrome_004.png" alt="" ><div class="caption">interned - Google Chrome_004</div></div></a>
Assuming you can somehow access the dumps, I probably won’t post them on this server because of the massive bandwidth usage, someone else could, the process for using it is very simple. Download the file to your  computer through <span class="caps">HTTP</span>, a torrent, or create it yourself. You might have noticed that the favicon is a picture of a carrot because that’s the current codename. Well, not really a codename, but I was scrolling through some icon lists and saw one for a carrot on the first page. I don’t even like carrots, but I digress. The dump uploading screen has a picture of a bunny biting a file upload carrot that you click on to select the file. Select the file, and it automagically copies it over to a persistent folder. Then you’re off to searching and reading articles and definitions&nbsp;:)</p>
<p>I’m not done yet, or at least, I don’t feel like packaging it up and submitting it to the chrome webstore yet because I need to figure out a good way to host database&nbsp;dumps.</p>

<p>Drag2Up, is an app named horribly, as I suck at naming things. It’s very simple in terms of capabilities - no buttons, no interface, which is pretty much the ideal type of user experience, something that’s intuitive and lends focus to content, not chrome. Really, this post isn’t useful in any way. What you should do, is <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/bjgjolhpdlgebodaapdafhdnikagbfll">install it</a> and try it out for yourself (Chrome only, It would be possible to make a firefox version, but I have no experience with Firefox extensions, and the new Jetpack isn’t quite out yet, though you can probably adapt the code relatively easily. Maybe a greasemonkey script by using GM_XHR). <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/bjgjolhpdlgebodaapdafhdnikagbfll">https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/bjgjolhpdlgebodaapdafhdnikagbfll</a></p>
<p>Drag and drop is probably one of the greatest forms of interaction ever, it’s intuitive and exemplifies the usefulness of a <span class="caps">GUI</span>. Recently, browsers have implemented drag and drop APIs (actually a <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2009/09/the_html5_drag.html">feature of <span class="caps">IE5</span>.5+ </a>but then codified into part of <span class="caps">HTML5</span>). Some browsers, namely Chrome and Firefox implement a dataTransfer property of the drop events that allow one to access files dragged from the user’s desktop (or file browser) onto a web application. The application can read the file through the File API, and do whatever it chooses. Probably most notably is Gmail’s utilization of the feature that allows dragging and dropping files from the desktop onto a message to upload it as an attachment. When it was announced, some people remarked how excited everyone was of a feature that was present in desktop clients for several decades&nbsp;already.</p>

<p>Browser vendors have the role of enabling developers to do cool stuff. It’s up to a web developer or service to maintain an application, to update it and add new features. Undoubtedly, many do, living on the bleeding edge of innovation, but most don’t, and stay locked in a certain state for years if not longer. Extension developers have no obligation to be entirely objective in terms of how it deals with websites, and many are site-specific, adding features to sites that lack them, integrated into the interface, utilizing product-specific APIs, or document structure. Browser vendors enable innovation, site developers integrate standards and browser extensions add features to sites, because the developer is unwilling or because of restrictions on the functionality of web apps (x-domain, persistence,&nbsp;etc).</p>
<p>Uploading images is a fairly common task, and the standard go-to-file-host-site, click-the-attach-button, browse-button-hitting, navigation-through-folders and waiting-for-page-to-reload-after-uploading, link-copying, tab-switching and pasting. Some applications like <a href="http://www.getcloudapp.com/">CloudApp</a> look promising in alleviating this needlessly tedious process, but only reduce the interaction steps a little. The ideal would be making that third-party file upload service integrate seamlessly into all web applications, with a level of integration akin to Gmail, drag and&nbsp;drop.</p>
<p>As awesome as it sounds, it’s not as easy to implement as one might like. The basic idea was to detect when a drag event started, and to iterate all the elements, adding an absolutely positioned, semitransparent mask to indicate that it’s a drop target. A few issues occur with that, I have <a href="/2010/10/drag2up-drag-files-onto-any-site/2010/10/gmail-style-html5-dragdrop/">a little writeup on those issues</a>.</p>
<p>A lot of <span class="caps">WYSIWYG</span> editors use iframes, and creating content scripts with all_frames: true doesn’t necessarily mean it runs on all frames (for some very odd reason). And also for some reason, there’s no way to access frames from window.frames in content scripts. So I have this hack where if there are frames, it injects some javascript into the real page executed in the page’s context to run it within the iframe (if it’s the same domain, as it always is in wysiwyg editors). Then events get propagated from the sub-frame into the parent window, through postMessage that is subsequently handled by the content script, forwarded to a background page using chrome.extensions.sendRequest, and it all happens in reverse once the server gives a response. As such, it’s a really bad idea to use this for large files since it needs to be passed around several times over several pages, and apparently <a href="http://blog.andrewvc.com/node-js-and-binary-data">V8 isn’t the best with big strings</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from that, uploading to imgur for some odd reason takes a long time. I don’t like sites that don’t have simple <span class="caps">JSON</span> POST APIs, and there really aren’t many that fit that criterion. So with the initial release, images are uploaded with imgur and text files are all uploaded to a github&nbsp;gist.</p>

<p>I was inspired by <a href="http://twitter.com/chrismessina/status/24791169387">chris messina</a>‘s idea of integrating Readability into a twitter client. Sadly, I don’t have newtwitter yet, so I can’t actually do that. But since I do have the ultrahackable Streamie client, I’ve updated<a href="http://antimatter15.streamie.org"> my fork of streamie</a> with that functionality. It relies on <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/nahmdndkmncjhppbaomnecihdmijgmne">a chrome extension</a> that sort of makes an exception to the cross domain policy that makes all frames with a <span class="caps">URL</span> that includes #readStyle automatically load the readability&nbsp;bookmarklet.</p>
<p>Inspired by&nbsp;this</p>

            <section class="content"><p>The idea of a Web Browser as the <span class="caps">OS</span> is nothing new, and most people know it. As for current things, they’re basically very restricted normal operating systems. <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/introducing-google-chrome-os.html">Google </a>wouldn’t do something like that without tons of innovation and killer&nbsp;features.</p>
<p>I’ve been watching some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/googletechtalks">google techtalks </a>in the past few days, and I think it was interesting how the one on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xKZ4KGkQY8">Wuala</a> (a distributed filesystem) was started with the google guy saying “this talk is being recorded so please refrain from mentioning any google sensitive information in your questions”. While it may be referring to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_File_System">Google File System</a>, I don’t think it’s too similar to <a href="http://www.wuala.com/">Wuala</a>. So I think the idea of cloud storage distributed among peers is an attractive idea since what would you actually use the hard disk which most netbooks do have, and keeping all your data locally doesn’t really contribute to the whole idea to cloud&nbsp;computing.</p>
