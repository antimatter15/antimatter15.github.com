              Hi. I’m <b>Kevin Kwok</b>, and I’m currently a sophomore at <b>MIT</b>, 
              and this is my obligatory online presence or whatever.  
            </p>
            <p>
              I regularly updated this site from 2007, when I started it in elementary school, 
              to summer 2014, when it was unwittingly absorbed into an international phishing ring.
            </p>
            <p>
              But like a phoenix, hydra or the national deficit, the site is back 
              again bigger than ever (after a rather long gestation period).
            </p>
            <p>
              For more obnoxious autobiographical content 
              blended with bits of nostalgia for the old PHP-on-sketchy-free-webhosting days, click here.

<p>I first registered an account on liveswifers.org on December 11th, 2006. I was 11 years old at the time. It was this time when the Ajax Animator began. I’m not sure of that, because 5 years past certainly constitutes ancient history for a teenager. It was a huge influence on the development of the Ajax Animator, and it was there that I first encountered some of the future contributors to the project. In fact, the community was kind enough to create an entire subsection of the forum intended to nurture discussion of my pet project, which paralleled their eternal vaporware attempt at resurrecting their namesake&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>Over the next few years, the community decayed and the site became desolate and spam-ridden. There was a period in late 2008 when every indication was that the site would come to an abrupt demise when the domain registration was to expire. The still active community created a backup community on some other forum hosting site and prepared for the worst. I did my part by running WinHTTrack and mirroring the site on my hard disk. It turned out the domain was renewed, and the panic was for&nbsp;nought.</p>
<p>But, when the website finally became a desolate and abandoned wasteland a few years later, the domain lapsed and all the content was&nbsp;lost.</p>
<p>In a nostalgic fit earlier today, I dug up that archive and uploaded it to Google Code. <a href="http://forkswif.googlecode.com/git/Liveswifers/www.pryjon.com/liveswifers/forums/index-2.html">Here you can browse the near entirety</a> of the liveswifers forum as it was, frozen in carbonite those three years ago. I can’t place that date, December, 2006 quite in context, but I would expect that to be approximately the date that the seeds of inspiration were planted. And so maybe not for anyone else, but this site and all its content holds a special place in my mind, and deserves a final resting place shielded from the harsh&nbsp;internet.</p>

<p>I’ve <a href="/2010/07/javascript-canvas-to-animated-gif/2009/08/webworkers-canvas-glif-gifencoder-client-side-animated-gif-generation/">tried this before</a> but it didn’t work. <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> can’t do <code>toDataURL(&#39;image/gif&#39;)</code>, and the primitive <span class="caps">GLIF</span> library couldn’t do much so I never had the opportunity to test my gif-merging code that I had. But I’m at it again, this time, porting it from the AS3GIF library, an awesomely comprehensive bitmap to binary gif encoder that even supports LZW compression (and the patent has luckily expired. Yay!). AS3Gif is supposed to “play and encode animated GIFs”, but since web pages can usually natively play GIFs fine, it’s only a port of the GIFEncoder portions of the library. And it works really well. The rest of this post is copied from the<a href="http://github.com/antimatter15/jsgif"> Github readme</a>. Interesting how the w2_embed/anonybot embed post was a blog post turned into readme, this is a readme turned into blogpost. I’ll start with a link to the Github repo&nbsp;anyway:</p>
<p><a href="http://github.com/antimatter15/jsgif">http://github.com/antimatter15/jsgif</a></p>
<h3 id="basic-usage">Basic&nbsp;Usage</h3>
<p>Since it pretty much <em>is</em> GIFEncoder, you could consult the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/as3gif/wiki/How_to_use#The_GIFEncoder">as3gif how-to&nbsp;page</a></p>
<p>But there are some differences so I’ll cover it here&nbsp;anyway.!</p>
<p><a href="/articles/2010/JavaScript%20canvas%20to%20(Animated)%20GIF/clock.gif">This is the <span class="caps">GIF</span> which was generated from the&nbsp;canvas.</a></p>
<p>You first need to include the <span class="caps">JS</span> files. It’s probably best if you include it in this order, but it shouldnt’ matter too&nbsp;much.</p>
<pre><code><span style='display:none' detected-language='handlebars'></span><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">script</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">type</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"text/javascript"</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">src</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"LZWEncoder.js"</span>&gt;</span><span class="javascript"></span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">script</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">script</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">type</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"text/javascript"</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">src</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"NeuQuant.js"</span>&gt;</span><span class="javascript"></span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">script</span>&gt;</span> 
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">script</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">type</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"text/javascript"</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">src</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"GIFEncoder.js"</span>&gt;</span><span class="javascript"></span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">script</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre><p>If you want to render the gif through an inline <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag or try to save to disk or send to server or anything that requires conversion into a non-binary string form, you should probably include <code>b64.js</code> too.</p>
<pre><code><span style='display:none' detected-language='handlebars'></span><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">script</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">type</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"text/javascript"</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">src</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"b64.js"</span>&gt;</span><span class="javascript"></span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">script</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre><p>Simple enough right? Now to convert stuff to <span class="caps">GIF</span>, you need to have a working or at least some imageData-esque&nbsp;array.</p>
<pre><code><span style='display:none' detected-language='handlebars'></span><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">canvas</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">id</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"bitmap"</span>&gt;</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">canvas</span>&gt;</span> 
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">script</span>&gt;</span><span class="javascript"> 
  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> canvas = <span class="hljs-built_in">document</span>.getElementById(<span class="hljs-string">'bitmap'</span>); 
  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> context = canvas.getContext(<span class="hljs-string">'2d'</span>); 
  context.fillStyle = <span class="hljs-string">'rgb(255,255,255)'</span>; 
  context.fillRect(<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,canvas.width, canvas.height); <span class="hljs-comment">//<span class="caps">GIF</span> can't do transparent so do white </span>
  context.fillStyle = <span class="hljs-string">"rgb(200,0,0)"</span>; 
  context.fillRect (<span class="hljs-number">10</span>, <span class="hljs-number">10</span>, <span class="hljs-number">75</span>, <span class="hljs-number">50</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">//draw a little red box</span></span></span>
</code></pre><p>Now we need to init the&nbsp;GIFEncoder.</p>
<pre><code><span style='display:none' detected-language='coffeescript'></span><span class="hljs-reserved">var</span> encoder = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> GIFEncoder();
</code></pre><p><em>If</em> you are making an animated gif, you need to add the&nbsp;following</p>
<pre><code><span style='display:none' detected-language='vhdl'></span>encoder.setRepeat(<span class="hljs-number">0</span>); //<span class="hljs-number">0</span> -&gt; <span class="hljs-keyword">loop</span> forever //<span class="hljs-number">1</span>+ -&gt; <span class="hljs-keyword">loop</span> n times <span class="hljs-keyword">then</span> stop 
encoder.setDelay(<span class="hljs-number">500</span>); //go <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">next</span> frame every n milliseconds
</code></pre><p>Now, you need to tell the magical thing that you’re gonna start inserting frames (even if it’s only&nbsp;one).</p>
<pre><code><span style='display:none' detected-language='dos'></span>encoder.<span class="hljs-built_in">start</span>();
</code></pre><p>And for the part that took the longest to port: adding a real frame.&nbsp;encoder.addFrame(context);</p>
<p>In the GIFEncoder version, it accepts a Bitmap. Well, that doesn’t exist in Javascript (natively, anyway) so instead, I use what I feel is a decent analogue: the canvas context. However, if you’re in a situation where you don’t have a real <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element. That’s <em>okay</em>. You can set the second parameter to true and pass a imageData.data-esque array as your first argument. So in other words, you can do <code>encoder.addFrame(fake_imageData, true)</code>as an alternative. However, you <em>must</em> do an <code>encoder.setSize(width, height);</code> before you do any of the addFrames if you pass a imageData.data-like array. If you pass a canvas context, then that’s all okay, because it will automagically do a setSize with the canvas width/height&nbsp;stuff.</p>
<p>Now the last part is to finalize the animation and get it for&nbsp;display.</p>
<pre><code><span style='display:none' detected-language='coffeescript'></span>encoder.finish(); 
<span class="hljs-reserved">var</span> binary_gif = encoder.stream().getData() <span class="hljs-regexp">//</span>notice <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> different from the as3gif package! 
<span class="hljs-reserved">var</span> data_url = <span class="hljs-string">'data:image/gif;base64,'</span>+encode64(binary_gif); 
</code></pre><h3 id="docs">Docs</h3>
<p>Each of the files exposes a single global (see, at least it’s considerate!). But since there’s three files, that means that there’s three globals. But two of them are more of supporting libraries that I don’t totally understand or care about enough to document. So I’m just gonna document&nbsp;GIFEncoder.</p>
<p><code>new GIFEncoder()</code> This is super parent function. You really don’t need the <code>new</code> keyword because It’s not really even using any special inheritance pattern. It’s a closure that does some <code>var blah = exports.blah = function blah(){</code> for no good reason. Anyway, it returns an object with a bunch of methods that the section will be devoted to documenting. Note that I’ve never tested more than half of these, so good&nbsp;luck.</p>
<p><code>Boolean start()</code> This writes the <span class="caps">GIF</span> Header and returns <code>false</code> if it&nbsp;fails.</p>
<p><code>Boolean addFrame(CanvasRenderingContext2D context)</code> This is the magical magic behind everything. This adds a&nbsp;frame.</p>
<p><code>Boolean addFrame(CanvasPixelArray image, true)</code> This is the magical magic behind everything. This adds a frame. This time you need
you pass <code>true</code> as the second argument and then magic strikes and it loads your canvas pixel array (which can be a real array, I dont care and I think the program has learned from my constant apathy to also not care). But note that if you do, you must first manually call
<code>setSize</code> which is happily defined just below this&nbsp;one.</p>
<p><code>void setSize(width, height)</code> Sets the canvas size. It’s supposed to be private, but I’m exposing it anyway. Gets called automagically as the size of the first frame if you don’t do that crappy hacky imageData.data&nbsp;hack.</p>
<p><code>void setDelay(int milliseconds)</code> the number of milliseconds to wait on each&nbsp;frame</p>
<p><code>void setDispose(int code)</code> Sets the <span class="caps">GIF</span> frame disposal code for the last added frame and any subsequent frames. Default is 0 if no transparent color has been set, otherwise 2. I have no clue what this means so I just copypasted
it from the actionscript&nbsp;docs.</p>
<p><code>void setFrameRate(Number fps)</code> Sets frame rate in frames per second. Equivalent to <code>setDelay(1000/fps)</code>. I think that’s&nbsp;stupid.</p>
<p><code>void setQuality(int quality)</code> Sets quality of color quantization (conversion of images to the maximum 256 colors allowed by the <span class="caps">GIF</span> specification). Lower values (minimum = 1) produce better colors, but slow processing significantly. 10 is the default, and produces good color mapping at reasonable speeds. Values greater than 20 do not yield significant improvements in speed. BLAH BLAH BLAH.&nbsp;Whatever</p>
<p><code>void setRepeat(int iter)</code> Sets the number of times the set of <span class="caps">GIF</span> frames should be played. Default is 1; 0 means play indefinitely. Must be invoked before the first image is&nbsp;added.</p>
<p><code>void setTransparent(Number color)</code> Sets the transparent color for the last added frame and any subsequent frames. Since all colors are subject to modification in the quantization process, the color in the final palette for each frame closest to the given color becomes the transparent color for that frame. May be set to null to indicate no transparent&nbsp;color.</p>
<p><code>ByteArray finish()</code> Adds final trailer to the <span class="caps">GIF</span> stream, if you don’t call the finish method the GIF stream will not be&nbsp;valid.</p>
<p><code>String stream()</code> Yay the only function that returns a non void/boolean. It’s the magical stream function which should have been a getter which <span class="caps">JS</span> does support but I didnt’ feel like making it a getter because getters are so weird and inconsistent. Like sure there’s the nice pretty <code>get</code> thing but I think <span class="caps">IE9</span>/8 doesn’t implement it because it’s non standard or something and replaced it with a hideously ugly blah blah. So Anyway, it’s a function. It returns a byteArray with three writeByte functions that you wouldn’t care about and a <code>getData()</code> function which returns a binary string with the <span class="caps">GIF</span>. There’s also a <code>.bin</code> attribute which contains an array with the binary stuff that I don’t care&nbsp;about.</p>
<h3 id="webworkers">WebWorkers</h3>
<p>The process isn’t really the fastest thing ever, so you should use WebWorkers for piecing together animations more than a few frames long. You can find the rest of the WebWorkers section on the actual readme, because the rest is just a huge block of code with&nbsp;comments.</p>

<p>One thing the ajax animator’s pretty bad at is stick figures. Sure it’s not impossible, but it can’t really compare with the ol-fashioned frame-by-frame joint-manipulation likeness of <a href="http://www.google.com/images?client=ubuntu&amp;channel=cs&amp;q=pivot&amp;qscrl=1&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;source=univ&amp;ei=GF0hTJejE4H98AaJ0qxg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=image_result_group&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDQQsAQwAw">Pivot</a>. It’s called stick2 because the <a href="/2010/06/stick-figure-animator/2010/02/stick-figures/">original experiment </a>with stickfigures was named stick.html, and when I went to extend it and didn’t feel like setting up a git/svn repo, I copied the file and named it stick2.html, and with no good project-naming skills, it stayed that&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>Anyway, this was a project that got pretty close to completion in early march, but I never bothered to blog about it until now. It should work pretty not-bad on an iPad J(except the color picker), though honestly, I’ve never tried&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The interface is pure jQuery/html/css. The graphics are done with Raphael, but the player actually uses &lt;canvas&gt; for no particular&nbsp;reason.</p>
<p>Basically, it’s organized into two panels, the left-side figures-box and the bottom timeline. The figures-box contains figures (amazing!) and clicking on them adds them to your canvas. The two defaults are the pivot-style stickman, and something called “blank” which is a root node with no additional nodes. Though it shows up as a orange dot, unless you add something to it, it doesn’t have any actual look when viewed in the&nbsp;player.</p>
<p>On top is the context-sensitive buttons. Well the buttons in my screenshot aren’t context sensitive, they’re permanent. But when you click on a node, a new set of buttons (and words too!) appears. One is a line and the other is a circle. Click them to add a new segment or circle to the currently selected node. Then are various settings for the current segment (each node other than the root one is associated with a segment). Clicking those allows you to modify them. Also, a red X appears on the right, and that basically means remove the node and the child&nbsp;nodes.</p>
<p>So, now you have some extra nodes, how do you change them? Simply hold it down and drag, and the the segments move as well. But note that the length of the segment doesn’t change as you move it. That’s because by default, it locks the length of the segments. There are two ways to get around it. The first is to hold shift while dragging. The second is to tap the little lock icon on the top&nbsp;left.</p>
<p>On the bottom, is the timeline with live-previews of your frames with a semitransparent gray backdrop of numbers. Switch between each one by clicking on them and add one at the end by hitting the green “Add new frame”&nbsp;button.</p>
<p>On the canvas, there are two yellow squares, those allow you to resize the&nbsp;canvas.</p>
<p>On the very left of the top toolbar, is the play button. Hit it and the figures toolbox minimizes and it plays out your animation. Click it again to get back. Then is a little upload button. Hit it and then a little box pops up with a link to where you can find your animation in a way that you can share and to edit (not actually edit, but more like fork, as each save is given a unique id). Next is the download button which you hit, and get prompted by a big prompt-box which you use to paste in the <span class="caps">ID</span> of the animation you (or someone else) has saved, so you can edit it. Most of the time that’s useless as when you send a link with the player, it has a button which says&nbsp;“Edit”.</p>

            <section class="content"><p>This isn’t really new, but I just remembered to write a post about it. <a href="http://antimatter15.com/ajaxanimator/ipad/">Ajax Animator for iPad</a> got a relatively minor, but certainly pretty important&nbsp;update.</p>
<p>The new update incorporates the <a href="http://github.com/davidaurelio/TouchScroll">TouchScroll j</a>avascript library to have nice flick-to-scroll-ness throughout native iPad&nbsp;apps.</p>
<p>The<a href="http://jsvectoreditor.googlecode.com"> VectorEditor</a> core had a few bug fixes, rotation now works and so does resizing (though it’s still susceptible to the<a href="http://code.google.com/p/jsvectoreditor/issues/detail?id=1"> always-existent resizing of rotated objects awkwardness</a> - I would love it for someone to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jsvectoreditor/source/browse/trunk/editor.js#383">fix it</a>). However, resizing doesn’t change the size of the bounding box, which is a somewhat awkward aesthetic but it’s still&nbsp;functional.</p>

            <section class="content"><p>Today I went to the magical Apple Store and tried out the iPad for the first time. I really have to say that it’s quite magical, though it doesn’t fulfill the criterion for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke’s Third Law</a> despite what <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/#video">Jonathan Ive</a> says. Though I really haven’t tried any large area multitouch interface before (sadly), and I would expect it to be a somewhat similar if not exact replica of the experience. Keynote and Numbers were pretty neat (I suck at typing on the iPad in any orientation, so I don’t like Pages). That’s enough to show that iPad is not just a content consumption tool as the iPod and iPhone primarily are, but also content&nbsp;creation.</p>
<p>Anyway, in a few minutes I just swapped the mousedown, mousemove, mouseup events with touchstart, touchmove, touchend events respectively in the core of VectorEditor, while adding a new MobileSafari detection script (var mobilesafari = /AppleWebKit.*Mobile/.test(navigator.userAgent);) and in a quite analogous “magical” way, V<a href="http://code.google.com/p/jsvectoreditor/source/detail?r=202">ectorEditor works in iPhone/iPod Touch</a> and theoretically iPad, Just dragging the vectoreditor files over to the Ajax Animator folder and recompiling should bring iPad support to Ajax Animator with virtually no&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>I haven’t tested it. Downloading XCode 3.2.2 right now so hopefully I can test it soon. Stupid how it’s what? 2.31&nbsp;gigabytes?!</p>
<p>And possibly, I could use PhoneGap to hack together a App Store app which does the same thing (and maybe charge for it, which might be a bit cruel as this application is open source and works equivalently online - but I guess that’s okay for those people who don’t read my blog &gt;:) ). Maybe get enough to buy an iPad&nbsp;:P</p>
<p>Anyway, though I’m pretty late to this and my opinion probably doesn’t matter at all, here’s a mini iPad review: It’s really really cool, feels sort of heavy, really expensive, hard to type on in any orientation (interestingly it has that little linke on the f and j keys with the keyboard which feels useless since I always thought the point of that was so you can tactile-ily or haptically or tactically or whatever the right word is, find the home row, but since there’s no physical dimension to an iPad, it just strikes me as weird and wanting of that tactile keyboard). Otherwise, browsing really really feels great. Only thing I miss is the Macbook Pro style 3 finger forward/backward gestures (@<span class="caps">AAPL</span> plz add this before iPad2.0, and also, get iPhoneOS 4.0 to work on my iPhone 2g or at least @DevTeam plz hack 4.0 for the&nbsp;2g!).</p>
<p>Oh, and for those lucky enough to have a magical iPad, the <span class="caps">URL</span> is <a href="http://antimatter15.com/ajaxanimator/ipad/">http://antimatter15.com/ajaxanimator/ipad/</a> at least until there’s enough testing to make sure that I didn’t screw up everything with my MobileSafari&nbsp;hacks.</p>

<p>I like stick figures, and browsing YouTube, I found some things on Pivot and Pencil (really awesome free desktop animation apps), and that made me think, Stick figures are awesome. So I’m going to add some better Stick Figure features into Ajax Animator and possibly upstream to VectorEditor&nbsp;eventually.</p>

            <section class="content"><p>Eventually, what will happen is a pluggable editor system and swapping between the new Mini <span class="caps">UI</span> and the old standard UI. The pluggable editor system will enable switching between the existing VectorEditor and OnlyPaths editors as well as SVG-edit. Possibly, OnlyPaths will be phased out as SVG-edit supports every feature of the former as well as many more. The priority editors with the new version will be VectorEditor (the Mini UI editor, based on Raphael so it works fine cross-browser, but is also much more limiting than the rest, including OnlyPaths which it partially replaces). SVG-edit is an awesome project which is being actively developed, and will add new features that may make the Ajax Animator viable for more than just stick figures. New features that will come from the transition could include Gradients, Curved paths, Wireframes, Zoom, Groups, Align tools, Rotation and Resizing (without bugs!), Polygon/Polyline editing, to name a small subset. It’s likely that SVG-edit will have far more features by the time it’s fully implemented. It’ll be&nbsp;awesome.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">SVG</span>-edit UI won’t fit well with the Mini UI (which I actually like more), so the classical UI will be&nbsp;revived.</p>

<p>If you have a Google Wave developer account, you can visit the above link to use the gadget. It supports almost all the features of the full normal Ajax Animator and many more. It includes better Text, Images, Rotation, Resizing (still needs work), Layer Visibility, Stability, Platform Support, Export options, etc. However it does notably lack the entire old right (east) panel, which also means no undo, or redo. Also since it uses a different graphics editor (VectorEditor), it does not have all the transform options which were present in OnlyPaths. It also supports the whole real time editing that Wave is so famous for. Two people can concurrently edit the same frame at the same time or one user can watch the animation while the others are editing and see the animation&nbsp;develop.</p>
<p>If you aren’t fortunate enough to use wave, you can use it without the collaborative features at <a href="http://antimatter15.com/ajaxanimator/wave/">http://antimatter15.com/ajaxanimator/wave/</a></p>

<p>In wave2 which is now a really complicated and massively slow library filled with tons of inelegant crap spanning almost 600 lines, the way it’s resolved (somewhat) is by not truly deleting things, but rather replacing it with&nbsp;<span class="caps">DELETED</span>/TIMESTAMP.</p>

<p>So I think that the Ajax Animator Wave thingy is almost done. I think it’s really awesome, there’s some new stuff in there that may help in collaboration. There is still a bit of dogfooding left (VectorEditor needs to be updated as while the new version of Raphael is being used which eliminates a lot of the hacks being used, the change in path APIs means that lines, polylines and paths all fail). So after a bit of more bug testing, I think it’s going to be pretty cool. It will definately be out by the time the 100,000 people join Google Wave (I can’t wait!). But I’m not sure if it will be today, next week, or the week after&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>So to show some cool stuff I can do, I’ll publish the first time this blog has ever really seen an animation by me. But here’s the first animation I’ve made (It uses the Wave, center and flip plugins which you can access in the script executor, but someone could easily and tediously do this by hand&nbsp;too):</p>
<p><a href="/articles/2009/Ajax%20Animator%20+%20Wave/Wavey.gif"><img src="/articles/2009/Ajax%20Animator%20+%20Wave/Wavey.gif" alt="Wavey" title="Wavey"></a> Try ignoring the probable trademark&nbsp;infringement.</p>
<p>The cool stuff being used here are first the ability to draw a rectangle, to multi-select, multi-copy, multi-paste and manual repeatition. After that, it’s multi-dragged down, and next frame then, the <code>Ax.plugins\[&quot;center&quot;]()</code> plugin is called which obviously centers all of them (by the Y axis, preserving the X one). Then it goes to the next keyframe and using <code>Ax.plugins[&quot;Sine&quot;](100,0.01)</code> (first arg defines multiplier for y axis and latter defines something I forgot, i think multiplier for the current X axis).  Then the same function but with <code>(100,0.02)</code> and then <code>Ax.plugins.flip()</code> to make it look like the wave logo. Do some multi-select and set the color. After that cool stuff, it gets saved as text and opened in OnlyPaths Ajax Animator (which also demos a really cool feature called forwards-compatibility). It gets saved as a <span class="caps">GIF</span> and uploaded to my blog after&nbsp;that.</p>

            </header>
            <section class="content"><p>For like an hour (so, not a really long time, and nothing near SVGWeb) or so, I was working on a new <span class="caps">SVG</span> shim similar to SVGWeb except that it renders to VML and SVG through Raphael rather than Flash (so now I can actually brag about not having <em>any</em> plugins :P). Using it is somewhat simpler than SVGWeb, except that you need some replacing, but no need for a server, htcs, etc. Plus, the file is only 3.2 kb uncompressed, only 740 bytes gzipped and <span class="caps">YUI</span>’d. Also, it only works with rectangles and ellipses but could be somewhat easily modified to support anything that raphael does. While probably it does not work on IE (as I use linux and have no way to test), it’s an interesting&nbsp;concept.</p>
<p>It only works with pages where a <span class="caps">SVG</span> element is added dynamically after the page is loaded (contrasting to SVGWeb which only allows a SVG element to be added in&nbsp;code).</p>
<pre><code><span style='display:none' detected-language='coffeescript'></span><span class="hljs-reserved">var</span> svgroot = rshimdoc.createElementNS(<span class="hljs-literal">null</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"svg"</span>); <span class="hljs-regexp">//</span>you coudl also just use normal createElement(<span class="hljs-string">"svg"</span>), but it must be rshimdoc instead <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">document</span>

svgroot.setAttribute(<span class="hljs-string">'width'</span>,<span class="hljs-number">100</span>); 
svgroot.setAttribute(<span class="hljs-string">'height'</span>, <span class="hljs-number">100</span>);


(<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> RHTMLElement(html element)).appendChild(svgroot)
</code></pre><p><span class="caps">OR</span></p>
<pre><code><span style='display:none' detected-language='objectivec'></span>rshimdoc<span class="hljs-variable">.getElementById</span>(element <span class="hljs-keyword">id</span>)<span class="hljs-variable">.appendChild</span>(svgroot)
</code></pre><p>So it doesn’t deviate too much from the <span class="caps">SVG</span> spec (just replacing document with rsvgdoc should work). And in other news, I’m moving some of my smaller works to github, so this project is also going to be hosted on&nbsp;GitHub.</p>

<p>I only got far enough to get drawing lines, paths, polygons and rectangles working. Ellipses and text do not work. Selecting a shape shows the tracker, but if you drag it then it just flies over to (0,0) and dies. Partly because I didn’t spend any more than an hour getting the port to work, but the issues I’ve encountered is that svgweb doesn’t implement shape.getBBox() (but it did provide shape._getX(), shape._getY(), shape._getWidth(), and shape._getHeight() so it wasn’t hard to implement that). Then was that since it’s using a flash shim, the events which they hook on the container with jQuery only show the evt.target as the &lt;embed&gt; which the flash resides in. But I got a strange hack where you have 2 copies of the event listeners and kill the selects from the jQuery one, but doing that makes unselecting&nbsp;impossible.</p>

            <section class="content"><p>I’m making a crude python script that translates <span class="caps">PHP</span> to JS rather hideously. It probably will not work on any other codebase. It was a script quickly hacked together to one&nbsp;purpose.</p>

<p>FreeMovie is an <span class="caps">SWF</span> generator library written in PHP and ported to Ruby. FreeMovie can be used to develop Web and desktop aplications.
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Speaking of the Ruby port, I can’t find it. So if anyone finds it, I think it might be useful somewhere.</span> Found it in the <span class="caps">CVS</span>, it’s really incomplete compared to the PHP&nbsp;version.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The machine translated code (Not <em>entirely</em> autogenerated, I wrote a line or two of it) is not too hideous, the tabbing is slightly off, but it’s at least mostly readable. It was a lot worse 2 hours ago (half of the lines had indentation, other without any, debugging comments everywhere saying useless and distracting&nbsp;things).</p>
<p>The translator is only 107 lines of (hideous code, though the language is beautiful, I guess if you loved <span class="caps">JS</span> enough, you could try running the program though <a href="http://www.skulpt.org/">skulpt</a>) python (+ 20 or so in another file to change chr() to String.fromCharCode, etc). After that, it uses 6 <span class="caps">PHP</span> compatibility functions and 5 from the PHP.js project to cover the features that I’m too lazy to  put in the compiler or are just not features in&nbsp;JS.</p>

<p>The above demo generates a flash image entirely client-side, though the resulting base64 encoded data is sent to be decoded on the server since you can’t load a <span class="caps">SWF</span> from a data-url. If someone finds out how, it would be cool to tell&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>A big issue though, is that for some odd reason half the shapes don’t work. The ones in the demo work, but all filled shapes, and the circles/arcs do not&nbsp;work.</p>

The first parts of my April 7th, 2007 post on&nbsp;Liveswiffers.org.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am working on a project to make an open-source browser based Flash Authoring&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>….. The idea is to make an animation on the site, save to the site’s server, and continue working on it later. Later being able to publish it and be sort of a YouTube for Flash Animations/Applications. Another aim of this project is to be next-gen software, sure there are about 10 open source multiplatform C++ based flash IDEs out there, but none of them truely [sic] represend [sic] the future of software, or true platform independence.
Another interesting fact is that I didn’t know what YouTube was until Google bought it. But with the idea for a “YouTube for animations”, is totally possible with the new infrastructure provided by Google Wave. People can mark their waves containing the gadget as with:public, and people could search, comment, and improve animations (Though I was thinking initially on a more opensource software-like fork system, than a wiki type system which Wave is, and I’m not certain how this will work out with in the evils called the “real world” since now, Wave is still just a&nbsp;theory).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What has it done which makes me think it’s reached this milestone? Well, finally, I can make stick figures and animate them as they were meant to be animated. Having multiple layers with visibility now works, and now it supports most of the beloved and mostly efficient workflow of the Flash <span class="caps">IDE</span> - or at least to a beginner like I was, and still&nbsp;am.</p>

<p>The name field will be replaced with buttons, and zoom may or may not be scrapped. Since gadgets only take up a fraction of the page (usually) it’s designed with size in mind, which may help on other space-constrained devices like&nbsp;netbooks.</p>
<p>It may have a cool feature like VectorEditor’s demo where you can draw off the canvas&nbsp;area.</p>

            <section class="content"><p>So I don’t actually have wave yet, but for all 2 of you (likely less) who have used <a href="http://pygowave.p2k-network.org/waves/">pygowave</a>, an <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pygowave-server/">open source </a>third party implementation of the <a href="http://www.waveprotocol.org/">wave protocol</a>. So there was how I developed it, I read through the APIs and tested on pygowave. So what does VectorEditor do that <a href="http://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/">svg-edit</a> and… erm… <a href="http://www.hokstad.com/static/wave/gadgets.html">svg-edit</a> don’t&nbsp;do?</p>
<p>First, VectorEditor for wave is <em>really really</em> real time. Waaay more real time than svg-edit (not really). But VectorEdit (VectorWave might be a nice name.. I’m going to try using that name from now on in this post) transmits the data such as even <strong>while</strong> the shape is still being drawn, rotated, or moved (rotation needs work). Another nice feature is that the transitions are animated so things are even more&nbsp;seamless.</p>
<p>Another important feature is shape locking. So when someone selects a shape, it gets locked and can’t be edited by anyone else. If anyone tries, an alert box appears saying “Shape shape:5sdfwef98dfe3ssdf is locked by user antimatter15@pygowave.p2k-network.org”. svg-edit (the latter) doesn’t support moving things after they’re created so it doesn’t really matter then, and I’m quite certain the former doesn’t do any type of&nbsp;locking.</p>
<p>And lets not forget the likely most important, yet totally untested feature that seperates VectorEditor from the rest: <span class="caps">IE</span> support, which is inherent since it uses Raphael for rendering, but <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/06/03/google_svg_internet_explorer/">it may not be necessary</a> since google may be making some shim-type system of hacking svg awesomeness onto <span class="caps">IE</span> and making the whole VectorEditor project&nbsp;useless.</p>
<p>So if you want to try it out, go to pygowave, sign up, create a wave and add&nbsp;the</p>

            <section class="content"><p>So yesterday, I worked a little on making a VectorEditor based Ajax Animator. It actually took suprisingly little work. The mostly modular and abstracted design of the Ajax Animator means that only a few files need to be changed. Mainly those in the js/drawing directory. Though there was a bunch of references to Ax.canvas.renderer.removeAll() which needed to be&nbsp;changed.</p>
<p>Another cool feature in that version is the ability to have layers show up concurrently. So you can see things while drawing just as they would be in&nbsp;export.</p>
<p>However, it’s not ready, it’s very very buggy, Lines and Paths aren’t tweenable yet, and it’s missing all those nice features of OnlyPaths that VectorEditor inherently&nbsp;lacks.</p>
<p>But the one really nice feature I think is the multi select. You can easily select a group of things which comprise some sort of shape, and move it all&nbsp;across.</p>

Enabling collaboration is important, and I’m a huge supporter of User Created content (virtually all my projects are open source, and they include some entirely user-created things like my <span class="caps">MMORPG</span>, Project Wikify, and a few others). At one point, since the old ajax animator (not anymore) would keep logs of everything previewed (as we needed to convert it to flash to preview). I would enjoy people trying out how things were like. That was in the day where there were to tools: rectangles and sticks, and the lines didn’t tween well. Color picking was unnecessarily complicated, the tweening engine crashed every minute, and couldn’t do anything, etc. Since the 0.2 rewrite, things are much better, but I still miss having those user-management&nbsp;features.</p>
<p>If you didn’t know that, User Management/Sharing has been in the ajax animator for a while. It was frequently added, removed, mutilated, upgraded, etc. I think it was there since the <span class="caps">DHTML</span> Goodies days (0.08?). It got removed for a while, got added again, removed, rewritten, and now removed again. I look forward to adding it&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>I guess much of it is already there. The login should look pretty much the same as the old one, but with the whole login thing replaced with a single OpenID box and a login button. I’m not exactly sure what to do after this. I think there should be a little profile box that replaces the login panel. I’m debating whether the profile should house a list of your saved animations, or if it should be nested into that Animation browser (that actually works!). I’m leaning towards the latter. The profile may house a link to your folder in the animation directory, a button to save your edits (as with File-&gt;Save-&gt;Webserver).&nbsp;Etc.</p>
<p>With that, it would include some form of user management system. I’ve almost completely settled on OpenID because of it’s flexibility, futuristicity, freaking-awesomeness (getting a bit overboard…). I’ve just been surfing the web (Wikipedia stuff) and I’m increasingly interested in OpenID, as it seems much more “ajax-friendly” than I previously&nbsp;thought.</p>
<p>Some time, i’d like to switch to a more scalable app-engine oriented system (it’s already serving up static <span class="caps">JS</span> now). I’ll use my server at antimatter15.com more (Java-Enabled), so there can finally be decent flash export&nbsp;:)</p>
<p>One thing that i’d really like, that’s really probably painful, is to better support <span class="caps">IE</span>. There’s no problem with IE support in the general components of the Ajax Animator (Tweening/UI/Save/Format/Abstraction Layer/etc), but rendering isn’t very good. I’d like for it to be better. OnlyPaths is already great, but IE support is big for it to become mainstream. I’d like it for use in a more educational and amature(ish) setting, where people have the most use for free/opensource/easy-to-run apps. In education, many people are still using IE, and that’s a big&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p>I’ve been looking into other renderers for the future of the Ajax Animator to run on. For the forseeable future, the editor will be OnlyPaths, because it is the only one that really fits the needs of the project. But it’s built on a less-clean, prototype-like (non-namespaced) foundation, and isn’t built exactly as it should. It’s not up to me, but I think that OnlyPaths should be an editor, rather than a renderer, or at least the renderer and the editor to have very visible lines between. Right now, much of the editor interface is in the renderer. That means a lot of unnecesary work. The addTracker function is currently in the renderer, this is completely the wrong thing. It was fine in the days when it was Richdraw and the tracker was just a blue square, but that’s not scalable. On this trend, you would need 2 copies of essentially the same code (<span class="caps">VML</span>/SVG) for the tracker/etc. I’d much prefer to have a interactive-less renderer and addTracker function in the editor, where all the actions are calls to the drawing API. Either Onlypaths has to get a better VML renderer, or we have to switch rendering engines to something like Dojo.GFX or Raphael and port the editor over to the new renderers. I like the current OnlyPaths one a lot. It’s been developed side-by-side with the Ajax Animator, and is very well integrated. I dont like Dojo.GFX too much, because it’s dojo-dependencies, but it’s a very solid and stable framework. And Raphael isn’t as powerful as the current OnlyPaths engine&nbsp;yet.</p>

<p>It has many of the features in OnlyPaths, but it keeps the core showTracker() and such functions in the main script, not in the renderer. That allows the system to be simpler, and more easily&nbsp;cross-platform.</p>
<p>I’m not currently using cross-platform event handling. so it only works in Firefox for now, but converting is&nbsp;easy.</p>

<p>I also split diff_core into diff_attr which allows you to diff only a single attribute at a time. I also added a diff_list function which would make it easier to implement an export format to a tweening engine like that of JavaFX and&nbsp;Silverlight.</p>
<p>On that note, I added fake support for JavaFX. so you now see the toolbar icon, and I added the script for javafx though there’s nothing in&nbsp;it.</p>

            </header>
            <section class="content"><p>I’m pleased to release the latest version of the Ajax Animator, 0.2. This version has been a complete rewrite of the application down to it’s core, not a single like of code copied from the old (0.14.7) release. It also happens to be the most advanced and complete release to date, with full multi-layer support, a greatly expanded toolbox, complete undo history, a shared clip-art library, a completely redesigned <span class="caps">UI</span>, and much&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>Lets start from when you open the app. The application speed has greatly improved, the 0.14.7 release takes ~9.5 seconds to load, 0.2 takes a mere 4.5 seconds, more than half the time. On the top toolbar, the buttons are relocated and restylized. Over at the file button, you see everything has new gorgeous icons intuitively organizing the New, Open, and Save options, where you can use the powerful new <span class="caps">JSON</span> based file format. Below that, you see a new Publish menu, where you can export to several formats like Adobe Flash, Processing (language), Microsoft Silverlight (XAML), and Animated&nbsp;GIFs.</p>
<p>Skipping over to the View meu, you see that there are 17 different <span class="caps">UI</span> themes to choose from. An unprescedented degree of customizability. And over at the Help menu, there is more useful content. A working FAQ, helpful Tip Of the Day, About page, and a list of keyboard&nbsp;shortcuts.</p>
<p>Of course the most important and powerful change in this version is the inclusion of the OnlyPaths editor. A new, powerful Vector graphics editor. The new editor allows you to draw not only the standard rectangles, ellipses, and lines, but also Text, Polygons, Freeform Paths, Images and more. You can now Rotate, Resize, and move shapes&nbsp;around.</p>
<p>The Timeline has also been reworked. The new archetecture allows the deletion of layers, expansion of tweens, and more. The Tweening engine is vastly superior, with much fewer bugs than the old one, though the new one certainly does <em>much</em> more and gets much more room to screw&nbsp;up.</p>
<p>A new Animations tab allows you to view and improve on public animations them. A new Properties panel allows you to adjust the canvas size and animation framerate along with the text content and image&nbsp;<span class="caps">URL</span>.</p>

<p>But… yeah. Tonight I added two very important features stemming from&nbsp;Properties.</p>
<p>the first is properties itself (duh). It allows you to change canvas Width, Height, and the animation framerate. Stemming from this, is the new feature in the Ajax Animator Format (<span class="caps">ALEON</span>, AXON, AXION, AJSON, AXFF, AFF or whatever you want to call it), you guessed it: Width/Height.

<p>I rolled back one thing yesterday: the Advanced Color-Picker tool. They <em>will</em> be added again later, but I don’t want to aim <em>too</em> high for the initial 0.20 release, or else it may never get released. The standard (albeit small) color picking system is fine for now. It also is quite big, so not&nbsp;yet.</p>

This should speed up the application a bit, and should also make it easier when updating some smaller things. As with that, it will also starting from build 83, create release archives of the CSS files. The compiler mechanism has changed a bit too, but that’s not really&nbsp;important.</p>
<p>The most visible additions, is the embedded Color Dialog. If you look at the title, you’ll find a Steve Jobs reference. Right below the huge drawing tools list (what? is it like 2 times that of the old version?) there is a Line Width slider (this is indirectly inspired by OnlyPath’s Mondrian-style color picker). it also embeds the Color Field plugin, so if you press the little button on the side, a little color palette shows up.

<p>Now, its at Ajax Animator Build 48. It has an improved “Properties” menu. The Drawing icons have been updated (to give you a taste of features of OnlyPaths that will be added). Notice that there are some features left out. Zoom will be done via the zoom button on the canvas toolbar, and panning won’t be necessary. I’m curious of whether I should or should not include the z-index ordering. Simply, the whole purpose of layers is that. and Layers seem much more managable, visible, and&nbsp;such.</p>
<p>Speaking of layers, the Layer browser part of the timeline has been added. It is currently just a simple Editor Grid (so you can inline edit the label!).  I’m going to add <a href="http://cellactions.extjs.eu/">http://cellactions.extjs.eu/</a> for the ability to remove/edit layers via a nice&nbsp;icon.</p>
<p>I have also almost sucessfully ported OnlyPaths to ExtJS. it turns out, that all prototype code is in richdraw.js, and it is as simple as replacing prototype code with Extjs&nbsp;counterparts.</p>
<p>such as
this.blahlistener = this.blah.bindAsListener(this)
Event.observe(this.explosion, “mouseexplode”,&nbsp;this.blahlistener)</p>
<p>becomes&nbsp;Ext.get(this.explosion).on(“mouseexplode”,this.blah,this);</p>
<p>Often, Ext code is simpler, and more consise, but other times it is not&nbsp;so.</p>

I’m probably not going to include Prototype because OnlyPaths is a <em>much</em> (~11x) larger project than RichDraw, and therefore, it is mainly out of trying to improve size. (the project is currently ~20kb, but with onlypaths, will become ~100kb, plus ExtJS, will be&nbsp;~1mb)</p>
<p>I might set up a blag and a separate site for the Ajax Animator (based off my alpha site from last release). I’m thinking of using WordPress/<span class="caps">PHPBB</span> but&nbsp;idk</p>

            <section class="content"><p><span class="postbody">Okay, so one day i felt crazy and changed everything by 1 decimal place because i don’t want this to seem misleadingly good. I mean, if it hits a 1.0 release, then some people would think it’s almost as good as Flash 1 (futuresplash animator) which it it isn’t even near&nbsp;yet.</span></p>
<p>So it should be 1.5 but now it’s 0.15&nbsp;:D</p>
<p>Read more to find out the whole list, a summary of it would be axml2, <span class="caps">UI</span> polishing, save space, nicer code (but still hideous), css, users, tweening, finish partially completed ideas&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p><span class="postbody">What’s done so&nbsp;far </span></p>
<ul>
<li>Redesigned Register&nbsp;<span class="caps">UI</span></li>
<li>Save Lots of&nbsp;code</li>
<li>New Save/Open file format (around 5x faster, and 10 times&nbsp;smaller)</li>
<li>Relocating&nbsp;stuff</li>
<li>interactive&nbsp;tutorials</li>
<li>Backwards Compat&nbsp;Mode</li>
<li>for the first time it’s gonna be a legitimate GPLv2 project (I’m gonna include the gpl.txt file for&nbsp;once)</li>
<li>replaced wz_tooltips with native ext.js&nbsp;ones</li>
<li>Change save file to computer&nbsp;architecture</li>
<li>change organization of Save/Open buttons in file menu&nbsp;(submenus)</li>
<li>optimized&nbsp;stuff</li>

<li>User friendly upload error message&nbsp;(yay!)</li>
<li>relocate&nbsp;css</li>
<li>delete lot’s of stuff from&nbsp;user-management</li>
<li><span class="caps">REAL</span> SUPPORT FOR LINES/ELLIPSES, lines didn’t work for tweening, ellipses didn’t work for tweening or flash, and ALL suffered from a programming error causing line-widths to be messed&nbsp;up.</li>

            </header>
            <section class="content"><p>I’ve not been releasing anything for a while, for several&nbsp;reasons:</p>
<p>1. I’m converting everything to the Ext <span class="caps">UI</span> (from textareas, tables, etc. to Ext grids, form fields)
2. I’m completely rewriting the timeline. including a host of new features much for speed. (several TIMES faster) mainly becuase it generates only 300 frames per layer by default, instead of 500, but automatically adds new frames DYNAMICALLY when more is needed. But the rewrite is sorta unstable
3. Tons of UI upgrades. A short list of changes from the top of my head are, a new login stystem (lot’s of fading effects) My Animations; list, faster animation loading. The user animation browser is completely changed-with stuff like Rating animations and comments coming.
4. Sorta goes in UI upgrades, is a new loading splash screen. It has a progress bar, showing status. And CSS is dynamically added, and loads from either the local server, or google code’s subversion (faster).
5. Cross Domain Ajax. The current ajax implementation only allows you to generate flash animations if you are on a php server with all the libraries/files installed. And sometimes you go to it from a proxy or google code beta or something. If that happens, you will not have any access to creating flash animations. So, soon it will curcumvent this restriction, by using a script tag hack, to load the animations from the server. Though the current ajax implementation will still be used for larger animations. And i might revive animation compression for this purpose.
6. Upgrading to Ext 2.0, this is not really happening NOW, but is being actively thought of. It’s not really a “painless” upgrade, with lot’s of stuff to modify/rewrite.
7. Everything has two options. One is to load from subversion, or the local server. It’s better if you load it from subversion, if you are mirroring it, or if your server is slow. And in many cases it’s really fast, and automatically gzip encodes the stuff. Great isnt it? so it has an option of loading all* (okay, most…) images and CSS from google&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>8. And even more&nbsp;stuff……</p>

<p>Gmail revolutionized email by offering a web based equivalent to Outlook and Thunderbird, except this was completely web based. No more Installing. So did Google Docs and Spreadsheets, or Zoho office, or etc, they had entirely free and web based clones of Microsoft Office or OpenOffice. Or Microsoft Windows, then there is Linux and now there is desktoptwo eyeos and youos.
I think of it as a development cycle, somebody makes something that is expensive, then something free, then something entirely Web based.
Now, what about Flash. According to adobe, 97% of all people who browse the Internet have flash player installed. By far larger than the amount of people who have outlook, thunder bird, Microsoft office, or Openoffice installed. Flash also accounts for a large percent of So why isn’t there a freeware open source replacement to this $400 software? There are though, <span class="caps">UIRA</span>, F4L, QFlash, KDSFlash, and more, but they are early in development. So when is the third generation web 2.0 equivalent for animation software coming? This is what I want to develop.
This is a project to make an open-source browser based Flash Authoring&nbsp;system.</p>
