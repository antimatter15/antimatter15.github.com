              Hi. I’m <b>Kevin Kwok</b>, and I’m currently a sophomore at <b>MIT</b>, 
              and this is my obligatory online presence or whatever.  
            </p>
            <p>
              I regularly updated this site from 2007, when I started it in elementary school, 
              to summer 2014, when it was unwittingly absorbed into an international phishing ring.
            </p>
            <p>
              But like a phoenix, hydra or the national deficit, the site is back 
              again bigger than ever (after a rather long gestation period).
            </p>
            <p>
              For more obnoxious autobiographical content 
              blended with bits of nostalgia for the old PHP-on-sketchy-free-webhosting days, <a href="/about/">click here.</a>

            </header>
            <section class="content"><p>Recently, the American public has been <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/prism">forcefully made aware</a> of the existence of various programs by the <span class="caps">NSA</span>- including massive infrastructure for intercepting all domestically routed communications to better protect us from imminent foreign threats. With legions of patriotic analysts, the NSA methodically ranks communications on the basis of their “<a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/06/06/nsa_prism_surveillance_private_data_from_google_microsoft_skype_apple_yahoo.html">foreignness</a>“ factor to determine candidacy for prolonged retention. Although it was developed with the best interests of the American people at heart, this program <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/james-clappers-least-untruthful-statement-to-the-senate/2013/06/11/e50677a8-d2d8-11e2-a73e-826d299ff459_blog.html">unwittingly</a> ensnares communications of purely domestic nature on the order of tens of thousands of incidents per day. These innocent mistakes are putting the agency at a great risk because the 4th Amendment of the Constitution expressly prohibits such affronts to American privacy. Making determinations of foreignness is hard, but to prevent further inconvenience to the American way of life, we should take these leaks as an opportunity for us on the civilian front to aid the <span class="caps">NSA</span> by voluntarily indicating citizenship on all our networked&nbsp;communications.</p>
<p>Here, we define the syntax and semantics of X-No-Wiretap, a <span class="caps">HTTP</span> header-based mechanism for indicating and proving citizenship to well-intentioned man-in-the-middle parties. It is inspired by the enormously successful <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3514"><span class="caps">RFC</span> 3514</a> IPv4 Security Flag and <span class="caps">HTTP</span> <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mayer-do-not-track-00"><span class="caps">DNT</span> header</a>.</p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>
<p><a href="/articles/2013/X-No-Wiretap/Screenshot-from-2013-08-22-214106.png"><div class="pic md" style="" ><img src="/articles/2013/X-No-Wiretap/Screenshot-from-2013-08-22-214106.png" alt="Screenshot from 2013-08-22 21:41:06" ></div></a></p>
<p>The <span class="caps">HTTP</span> header, “X-No-Wiretap” takes the value of the current user’s given name under penalty of perjury. The full name must be immediately followed by identity verification in the form of a standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_security_number"><span class="caps">U.S.</span> Social Security Number</a>, formatted with a hyphen “-“ after every third and fifth&nbsp;digit.</p>
<p>Future revisions of the protocol may introduce additional forms of verification, as while the presence of an <span class="caps">SSN</span> should be able to lower the foreignness coefficient of the vast majority of domestic communications to well below 51%- initial research seems to indicate that the combination of full first name and SSN is able to reduce an associated message’s foreignness factor by over 76.8% for 99.997% of Americans. However, there is a chance that certain instances may additional require Passport, Driver’s License, Address, Birthdate, Mother’s Maiden Name, and Childhood Best Friend’s Name to further lower the foreignness factor. This capability will be addressed in future versions of the&nbsp;protocol.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-ssl-tls-">What about&nbsp;<span class="caps">SSL</span>/TLS?</h2>
<p>Of course adding encryption makes it substantially more difficult for the <span class="caps">NSA</span> to interpret the content of what a user is sending, and increases the chance that they may unwittingly collect and retain your communications. In order to address these concerns, this proposal necessarily deprecates all the SSL/TLS ciphers in favor of Double <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13"><span class="caps">CAESAR</span>’13</a>, a thoroughly studied and well-known military-grade solution which offers excellent modes for graceful&nbsp;redegradation.</p>
<h2 id="isn-t-it-dangerous-to-send-your-social-security-number-in-plaintext-along-with-every-request-">Isn’t it dangerous to send your social security number in plaintext along with every&nbsp;request?</h2>
<p>Conventional security warns of the possibility of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">man-in-the-middle attacks</a>, but these new intelligence revelations require entirely new types of cryptographic thinking. Here, the trusted entity is not the server acting at one end, it’s not even the user issuing the requests- but rather, it’s the bureaucracy sitting in the middle politely intercepting all traffic for benevolent analysis- protecting your way of&nbsp;life.</p>
<p>One may be tempted to characterize this as a sacrifice of privacy in order to optimize security, but this position is simply naive. Every new progressive initiative of the government advances both fronts- both security and liberty, never at the expense of either. If you take a holistic long term perspective on the impact on a global scale with a vast array of (classified) information sources, there is very little question that you too would arrive at the same conclusions on the genuine merits of this surveillance&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>In this case, the removal of encryption ensures that the government is able to parse the content of messages to identify terrorists. At the same time, the inclusion of the citizenship identification information should give citizens the safety of mind, knowing that their messages will not be stored indefinitely in a <span class="caps">NSA</span>&nbsp;datacenter.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-identity-theft-">What about Identity&nbsp;Theft?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>What if you set up a server to transparently capture the browser headers? Any malicious entity could then collect all the social security numbers and real identities of everyone who happened to stumble onto their websites and use the information to sign up for credit cards, create hazardous investments, threaten or blackmail loved ones, and masquerade as a citizen while doing terrorist activities!
There isn’t any <em>real</em> evidence that such sweeping surveillance will even substantially reduce the chances of events that are intrinsically outliers anyway. On the other hand, <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/05/lifelock-identity-theft/">identity theft is a real world issue</a> which affects millions of Americans on a daily basis- and these changes will only make our <em>real</em> problems worse.
— <em>Short-Sighted&nbsp;Critic</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our government has to reconcile with the fact that the flow of information has radically shifted in the past few decades- all the previous paradigms of privacy, security and adversaries have been obsoleted. Understandably, they need to create infrastructure to tackle this next generation of attacks. This could mean highly orchestrated attacks being planned online, and the government is justified in trying to exercise every available option to avert the next cyber-9/11. Our adversaries may have no limits to their capabilities, and so waiting for definitive evidence on the efficacy of counter-intelligence approaches is giving them an opportunity to plan their next&nbsp;attack.</p>
<p>When what’s at stake is the American way of life, it’s easy to put aside things that don’t really&nbsp;matter.</p>
<p>If the terrorists do find a way to cheat the foreignness heuristic, that’s not a problem, because this proposal is backwards compatible with the existing catch-all <span class="caps">NSA</span> policy. They can always, in the end, ignore the X-No-Wiretap header, but we wouldn’t know so it’d be&nbsp;okay.</p>
<h2 id="when-can-i-use-this-">When can I use&nbsp;this?</h2>
<p>It’s expected that this proposal will breeze through the standardization process- because we as Americans can always get together and do that which must be done in these times which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Crisis">try men’s souls</a>. Browsers should implement the feature as soon as possible, so that people can make use of the increased sense of security and privacy it&nbsp;affords.</p>
<p>If you’re truly eager to try it out, you can contribute to the prototype <a href="https://github.com/antimatter15/x-no-wiretap">chrome extension</a> which supports the header injection (the reversal of <span class="caps">HTTPS</span> Everywhere, a feature called HTTPS Nowhere hasn’t been implemented yet, but we’re accepting pull requests!). Since this extension is still experimental, inserting your personal identifiable information must be done by editing the source code, but you should expect a more user friendly interface in the next revision. Since it isn’t thoroughly tested, there may be a chance that it fails to leak the user’s personally identifiable information with every networked request, but rest assured this will be fixed as soon as the bugs are made aware to&nbsp;us.</p>
<p>We should all rally behind this proposal for a simple technical solution which will go a great length to simultaneously enhancing both privacy and security, while overall preserving the only thing which matters, our American way of&nbsp;life.</p>

            </header>
            <section class="content"><p>Longer passwords are more secure. But if you’ve ever been on a website or computer network which mandated that you change your password every 30 days to a string which you haven’t used in the past 180 which could not contain any part of your username or an English language word without being liberally adorned with num3r1cal and sy#b@!ic substitutions and aRbiTRarY capitalization, you should be able to understand the pain of long and arcane&nbsp;passwords.</p>
<p>At time of writing, I’m a high school senior with something on the order of three weeks left in school. I can’t help but feel a tad wistful of the four years I’ve spent roaming these red-tinted halls of learning. Many of the particularly bittersweet memories include <span class="caps">PE</span>, a mandatory elective for my freshman and sophomore years. A bizarre policy forbid the possession of backpacks in the locker rooms, leading to the acquisition of the skill to open rotary combination padlocks, a skill which I just as quickly dispossessed myself of, having absolutely no need for a locker after&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>During that time, I had read about a pretty nifty hack involving Master Locks at the time. If you entered the combination and opened the lock and closed it again and left it on the last digit, you could open it again by rotating clockwise by fifteen and rotating back to the final digit (to fight the possibility of attackers who are aware of the exploit, you could turn the dial clockwise some number less than 15 after locking it, so that you would only have to remember the final digit). It was this trick that I used to open my locker just about every other school day for those  two years- a reduction in security no doubt, but a great convenience. I’ve been thinking over the design of the lock recently, and I’m not sure if it’s better classified as a bug or a feature. Conventional wisdom dictates that no doubt this substantial reduction in the key space is a rather severe design flaw. The fact that many newer locks were immune (a lot of locks will snap the dial forward when closed so that it is physically impossible to land on the final digit) to this trick seems to support the notion that this was somehow an undesired consequence of locksmithery rather than some kind of delightful&nbsp;accident.</p>
<p>But the more I think about it, the more this bug seems like a feature. Perhaps the loss of security isn’t nearly as egregious as it appears, and this little shortcut is actually a delightful little accident. Nearly every school day, I’d only have to take four seconds to open my locker because of this handy trick, except on those occasions some kid before me decided to walk around the lockers to press their heads against the metallic locks to spin them and pretend they can lock-pick, in which case, I’d have to enter the whole combination to <em>open __sesame</em>. That is, you only need to know one number to open it unless someone earlier guessed wrong, in which case, you’d have to enter three&nbsp;numbers.</p>
<p>The next story is about an&nbsp;iPhone.</p>
<p>I playfully grab at a friend’s phone for the second time in a week. A friend takes a selfie using the newly emancipated phone, with a rather contorted grin. I dutifully replace her lock screen photo, which had previously been an aerial shot of her grassy picturesque college campus with my friend’s contorted close-up selfie. She learns to be a bit more protective about her phone, quickly issuing a light tap on the power button to reengage the lock screen, a four headed Cerberus with an exponential backoff growl. But this doesn’t mean anything to the enterprising background changer, because the unlocking gesture happens all the time and it’s fairly easy to figure out what numbers someone’s&nbsp;typing.</p>
<p>This is a fairly innocent class of authentication breach, but it should be fairly unnerving given the extent to which our lives and personal information are accessible. Anyway, these two stories led me to think about ways to both simplify the process of entering passcodes and passphrases while simultaneously hardening against some general attacks, in particular replay attacks (and to a lesser extent, man in the&nbsp;middle).</p>
<p>The premise is simple enough: As you’re typing a password, letter by letter and stroke by stroke, each character is processed (either locally, or sent to a server). As soon as the authorization engine is comfortable with the amount of data provided, it sends a signal so that no more data is transmitted, and that authorization is&nbsp;complete.</p>
<p>In the same manner as the old MasterLock, maybe in a particularly auspicious occasion, one might only need one or two symbols in order to prove their identity. However, if the wrong digit is entered on the first try, the subsequent attempt must then obviously come with increased difficulty. Likewise, it may be advantageous to have a low initial difficulty if the login scenario seems very ordinary, which can be determined by any number of variables, including but not limited to the current <span class="caps">IP</span> Address, the location as determined by GPS or other means, stylometrics such as the rate and delay between typing individual letters, the number of simultaneous concurrent sessions, how the last session ended (by timeout or by an active logout). But an important part of the  system is that the difficulty has to be non-deterministic, because if we assume the attacker knows the system and can manipulate the variables at play, there is still a last vestige of hope that the attacker’s first guess is wrong (after that the difficulty climbs and the attacker is no longer really a&nbsp;problem).</p>
<p>Note that the server would not specifically reveal that a password is incorrect (until it’s manually submitted, like in existing systems). It would only indicate when the received content is&nbsp;sufficient.</p>
<p>In a keyboard input scenario, for a shell prompt or for generic password entry, it’s probably important to keep the text box open until the user acknowledges that he has been authorized, however in case the connection has been compromised by a non-interactive eavesdropping man in the middle with the intent to replay the password, the client should stop sending additional letters as soon as the server signals that it’s ok. This gives the server the option of never revealing to the user whether a response is sufficient, essentially forcing the user to enter the entire password and pressing&nbsp;submit.</p>
<p>Like how some safes or button pads have duress codes that silently call the police when triggered, there system could ignore invalid characters that prepend the actual password for entry, while subsequently blacklisting that given prefix and raising subsequent&nbsp;difficulty.</p>
<p>Of course this isn’t a complete solution. There needs to be some segmentation of access based on current authorization levels. For instance, checking whatever new mail or facebook statuses exist probably does not warrant much authentication friction, but combing through old personal documents and emails, installing root software or changing system settings, should probably require higher levels. This can probably help in that by keeping a unified password of sorts for all levels, but isn’t itself a complete solution. Two factor authentication is also important, in case a single device is compromised or some part of the scheme is&nbsp;untrusted.</p>
<p>I think it’d actually be pretty cool to see something like this implemented, because I think it might serve as a genuinely useful feature that enables a continuously variable spectrum that varies between when security is a situational necessity and when excessive user friction is&nbsp;detrimental.</p>

<p>Here’s an idea for fighting phishing that seems to be a good idea (at least to me). I’m no security expert, but from what I understand about <span class="caps">MITM</span> and other issues, this should provide a decent solution. It could probably even help<a href="http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/a-new-type-of-phishing-attack/"> fight&nbsp;tabnapping.</a></p>
<p>The identicon was first thought of by Don Park and he has envisioned <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080510221519/http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2007/01/22/identicon-based-anti-phishing-protection">something pretty interesting</a> that uses identicons for a similar purpose, however it requires certain changes to user agents and no browsers have yet implemented&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that on the login page, the server generates an Identicon based on the hash of the user’s <span class="caps">IP</span> address and a certain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography">secret salted string</a>). This will generate a unique, and extremely hard-to-fake image that is associated with whatever computer (or network under <span class="caps">NAT</span>) the user is at. The great thing is that it requires absolutely no changes to the existing user experience, isn’t too aesthetically jarring and completely ignorable. If the user’s under a proxy and is aware of it, this doesn’t detract from the user experience, it’s just a visual sign that the user might be on the wrong site and it’s up to the user to decide whether or not to go&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>The login identicon is a unique signature of the server you’re communicating to and the <span class="caps">IP</span> address of your computer, if either one is slightly different, the icon will be completely&nbsp;different.</p>
<p>As the tabnapping issue shows, the problem isn’t that users are too lazy to read the <span class="caps">URL</span> bar, it shouldn’t even really be necessary to read the URL bar. There are far too many funky unicode hacks that can make URLs look like other URLs, and people’s memory of exact textual strings isn’t that good. Plus, imagine how much of humanity’s time will be wasted having to break the usual eye movement and look at a small box on the top, thinking intensely for a few seconds before returning back to the usual login procedure. Expecting people to do that is just too&nbsp;much.</p>
<p>This solution, however should provide an image that can be embedded (ideally) on or immediately next to the login box, so the user just notices it instead of searching for&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><del datetime="2010-12-23T23:49:32+00:00">I’ll probably provide a proof of concept soon, it’s six in the morning and I’m about to go to school. </del> And <a href="http://antimatter15.com/misc/identicon/login.php">here</a> it&nbsp;is.</p>
