              and this is my obligatory online presence or whatever.  
            </p>
            <p>This is my little corner of the internet, where I talk about random projects and ideas and stuff. </p>

            </header>
            <section class="content"><p>I’ve been maintaining this blog, or at least the content inside it for about five years now. It’s been through a handful of incarnations, often paired with significant changes in web hosting. I’ve had a blog for a little bit longer, but I don’t think I have the medium figured out. The structure of the posts and the style has changed over the past few years, but I can’t at this point call it evolution, a positive progression. Part of the power which lies in analyzing data is the ability to realize patterns, often at a different scale from human observation (spans of months or years) which are equally if not more&nbsp;insightful.</p>
<p>That’s been my personal attraction to data science. I’ve had a couple of personal experiments involving collecting data about my daily activities, my old writing and code in hopes of distilling the changes that I’m too conceited to admit without the infallible hand of statistics. For nearly two years now, I’ve logged my entire life within precision of approximately 30 minutes from Google Calendar (or the Calendar app on iPad which syncs to Google Calendar). Actually, the label is slightly off, I quite often dedicate large spans of time to more or less useless labels like “not productive”. But this temporal information falls apart in terms of its richness, for my schedule is dictated more so by the mandatory rhythms of school life than the drifting cadence of other&nbsp;behavior.</p>
<p>But I digress. This isn’t about why I collect data so much as “I have this data, now what?”. In this case, I had a hypothesis, a rather simple albeit morbid one at that “my blog is dying”. It’s not hard to see how I’m coming at the conclusion. I’m pretty much struggling at this point to meet my goal of one post per month (itself not a particularly difficult goal, but as time has gone on and my posts have become more infrequent, I feel more compelled to write obscenely long posts to compensate, but of course this also leads to big posts sitting there unfinished for long durations losing the sort of one post = one sitting mentality). But before I ramble for too long, I’ll cut to the chase and answer the question posed at the beginning of this paragraph: “Graphs.” (you could imagine those haunting glyphs levitating in the midst of air caught in the invisible grasp of Giorgio A. Tsoukalos, or better yet, I can spare your cognitive abilities by <a href="http://qkme.me/3qj5f6">making it real</a>)</p>
<p><a href="/articles/2012/Meta%20Analytics/blog-post-frequency.png"><div class="pic md" style="" ><img alt=""  src="/articles/2012/Meta%20Analytics/blog-post-frequency.png" ><div class="caption">blog-post-frequency</div></div></a></p>
<p>Here’s a pretty little graph I made in R (sorry for the mess on the horizontal axis, and I just realized I have no idea as to how to interpret the dates, I’m assuming that they’re linear and it’s just some odd aliasing issue that makes even-numbered years repeat twice), it’s a histogram of the dates of posts that I’ve made to this blog (extracted with a simple Python script and Wordpress’s built-in Export button).You can probably actually tell that the blog’s demise is quite a long way’s coming. Every annual peak ends up shallower the following year and the first time <em>gaps</em> have actually existed was this fateful year,&nbsp;2012.</p>
<p>It’s actually sort of interesting that these peaks exist, but I can’t really tell during what months that happened during (since these axes are labeled so terribly, it’d be nice if I knew some nice interactive graph engine that worked with histograms, something like that cool time series viewer that Google had for Finance for like ever but for histograms, but I guess that just shows how much of a non-scientist I am, to have no idea how to fluently articulate in a statistical or graphical language of my&nbsp;choice).</p>
<p><a href="/articles/2012/Meta%20Analytics/Word-Count-Plot.png"><div class="pic md" style="" ><img alt=""  src="/articles/2012/Meta%20Analytics/Word-Count-Plot.png" ><div class="caption">Word Count Plot</div></div></a></p>
<p>For more graph fun, here’s a scatter plot of word lengths as a function of year. I wasn’t dedicated enough to figure out how to get <a href="http://nltk.org/"><span class="caps">NLTK</span></a> to tell me the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunning_fog_index">Gunning-Fog</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_test">Flesch-Kincaid</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Readability_Index"><span class="caps">ARI</span></a> value for individual posts, and I doubt that would end up showing anything particularly insightful. But yeah, so here it is. Charts. Charts of words. Note that thing that sticks out clocking in at around 3724 words is my first <a href="http://antimatter15.com/wp/2011/05/uploading-mp3s-to-google-music-beta-from-linux-chrome-os-win-and-mac/">Music Alpha</a>&nbsp;post.</p>
<p>Actually, I won’t mind that Wordpress isn’t yet self aware (‘ello Skynet) and still sends trackbacks and pings (whatever they are) to me when I link to myself. Seriously, you <em>don’t actually need to have a self-aware artificial intelligence in order to learn how to not spam me with emails when I’m quite probably as in super definitely aware of its existence</em>. But anyway, I guess I’ll stomach the lurching pain of a thousand emails (I’m using hyperbole here, in case your rudimentary artificial intelligence algorithms can’t quite distinguish them, but I’m also pretty sure your algorithms wouldn’t be able to handle n-th degrees of meta, so this excruciatingly useless parenthetical wouldn’t be much other than that: excruciatingly useless) and post the last part of the list&nbsp;here.</p>

</code></pre><p>That list was compiled by the command <code>cat blogtimes.csv | sort -t&#39;,&#39; -k3n | tail</code>, and that’s quite an accomplishment because I had to look up the arguments for the <code>sort</code> command in order to figure that out. Of course, <code>blogtimes.csv</code> is the output of my magical six line python script (which uses BeautifulSoup to extract all the <code>wp:post_date</code>s).</p>
<p>So, with 10 blog posts in that list, every single 8 of them happened after 2011 and 3 of them happened in 2012. Considering that there were 10 things published in 2012 (according to my dataset) and 21 in 2011, that’s a rather significant fraction of the stuff which has been written recently to be insanely&nbsp;long.</p>
<p>Wordpress tells me this post is now at 948 words, so I guess I’ll add a bit of concluding at the end to push it over the magical power-of-ten barrier, so presumably you should brace for the terrible boom which occurs at this point (oh, what’s that? I think that’s my imaginary telephone operator who informs me when I make a factual error, apparently those kinds of booms only happen with waves, and apparently words flowing through word count orders of magnitude don’t&nbsp;count).</p>
<p>The original title of this post was “Meta Analytics <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Upcoming Changes”, but in the spirit of the upcoming changes, I’ve moved the “Upcoming Changes” part into its own post (tentatively titled “Upcoming Changes”). You can probably at this point guess that “Upcoming Changes” involves something to tackle the excessive verbosity and to mitigate the absurdly infrequent posts. This probably doesn’t sound nearly as heroic to you as it does to me, because I’m listening to The Avengers soundtrack right now, and “A Promise” is pretty&nbsp;dramatic.</p>

            </header>
            <section class="content"><p><a href="/articles/2012/Swipe%20Gesture%202%20Development/4WsjX.png"><div class="pic md" style="" ><img alt=""  src="/articles/2012/Swipe%20Gesture%202%20Development/4WsjX.png" ><div class="caption">4WsjX</div></div></a></p>
<p>So I’m trying something new, returning to quasi-daily somewhat short updates about the development of whatever I’m working on rather than withholding everything until something of somewhat acceptable release quality is achieved. I have a blog post about that transition, but I’m still working on it (as in, writing it is somewhat boring). It’s probably better given my development cycle is quite nonlinear, usually I get something somewhat promising made in the first few days or so and pause for long and possibly indefinite durations doing other stuff in the process. Probably, writing short blog posts about what I have yet to finish will remind me to, well, finish them. Just maybe. But I’m probably going to have to preface every post that I write with this kind of disclaimer until I actually get that post finished and published so I have something to reference rather than pointing crazily into the air and saying “oh yeah, it’s coming, now, someday,&nbsp;maybe.”.</p>
<p>Starting about yesterday, I started working on the successor to Swipe Gesture. The new version tries to mimic the actual behavior of Chrome on Lion, which I think is really quite cool. Here’s a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-LY6-UdtO8">video I found on YouTube</a> which shows how it basically looks like if you aren’t familiar with it. The first thing to notice that it’s substantially less trivial, code-wise. No more is it a 30-line software lightweight, but it’s not _too _complex and arcane to forbid any kind of comprehension. Now, the simple prototype of its functionality is already nearing 300 lines of&nbsp;code.</p>
<p><a href="/articles/2012/Swipe%20Gesture%202%20Development/Screenshot-from-2012-08-14-111944.png"><div class="pic md" style="" ><img alt=""  src="/articles/2012/Swipe%20Gesture%202%20Development/Screenshot-from-2012-08-14-111944-150x150.png" ><div class="caption">Screenshot from 2012-08-14 11:19:44</div></div></a></p>
<p>Another big difference is now it’s no longer designed strictly for Chromebooks. In fact, one of the reasons for starting this was that I was informed that the kind of functionality might be useful on Macbooks running Windows via Bootcamp. In fact, it’s meant to be as general as possible, to work on pretty much any kind of platform. And it’s not even bound strictly to the horizontal axis: the code is meant to work with linear swipes in any direction including diagonally (although some experimentation on my chromebook seems to indicate that swiping at angles isn’t terribly&nbsp;useful).</p>
<p>The most significant conceptual change is the transition between a speed/acceleration metric to a distance metric. That is, in the old version, an action was triggered when there was a swipe in one direction vigorous enough to be considered. This was a fairly simple way to avoid the problem of distinguishing between a horizontal scroll action and a swipe by not making a distinction. In a sense, cheating. The new version instead does things “the right way™” by observing events carefully to determine if a swiping action actually results in scrolling. If that’s your kind of thing, the technical nitty gritty details have their own <a href="http://antimatter15.com/wp/2012/08/determining-if-a-mousewheel-event-results-in-scroll/">dedicated blog post</a>, so feel free to click through if you’re&nbsp;interested.</p>
<p>Once it’s determined that that scroll thing is actually probably a swipe gesture, it renders a nice little arrow in canvas. I considered using a unicode arrow and setting the font to huge, but that didn’t turn out quite as well as I expected (plus, it makes rotations and interactions with the embedding page <span class="caps">CSS</span> a little less&nbsp;predictable).</p>
<p>Also another thing is that it turns out that it’s a bad idea to set a css transition on something which is meant to hook with mouse or scroll movements because, while this ends up smoothing things out (which is good for mouse wheels because they click to the nearest 120 magical click units) it ends up producing a significant amount of lag and just feels so&nbsp;awkward.</p>
<p><a href="/articles/2012/Swipe%20Gesture%202%20Development/Swipe2.png"><div class="pic md" style="" ><img alt=""  src="/articles/2012/Swipe%20Gesture%202%20Development/Swipe2-150x150.png" ><div class="caption">Swipe2</div></div></a></p>
<p>Another thing (since this post is written over the course of several days, and the actual update has already been published at time of writing) is the cool redesign of the Settings page. The first thing to notice is that the settings page for once actually has settings, which is quite an accomplishment by itself. Also, it has a visual refresh that makes it look somewhat bootstrap-esque. That’s because ever since using Bootstrap in the making of Protobowl (a rather big project that I have yet to blog about), I’ve pretty much fallen in love with the color <code>whiteSmoke</code>. Partly because it has a name, which means I don’t have to google it or tattoo it on my arm for a mnemonic’s sake, and also because it’s a pretty nice&nbsp;color.</p>

            </header>
            <section class="content"><p><a href="/articles/2012/Raspberry%20Pi/Raspi_Colour_R.png"><div class="pic md" style="" ><img alt=""  src="/articles/2012/Raspberry%20Pi/Raspi_Colour_R-248x300.png" ><div class="caption">Raspi_Colour_R</div></div></a>As part of the shift between long multi-kiloword blog posts which are somewhat more like press releases back into a sort of more personal (i.e. blog-esque) format, I guess I’ll talk about my newly-arrived <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi">Raspberry Pi</a>. Right now, there isn’t terribly much to talk about since I’ve only had it for about two&nbsp;weeks.</p>
<p>I’ve been planning on getting a Raspberry Pi for a pretty long time, and I was actually pretty excited about that. For the weeks preceding the official announcement, I built a tiny script which ran in a ten-minutely cron job which would basically download the purported Raspberry Pi store (raspberrypi.com, note the dot-com rather than dot-org, which their homepage is situated at) and compare the hash, notifying me via Ubuntu’s built in notification&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>On that sleepless night when the actual pre-sale announcement was being made, I was incessantly checking <a href="http://raspberrypi.com">raspberrypi.com</a>, which had suddenly morphed into a server maintenance message (which remains to this very day). The anticipation was intense, and some twenty minutes after it was supposed to happen was when I realized that the whole time I had been checking the wrong page. The announcement came instead on <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">raspberrypi.org</a>, their main blog, and by that time, it was certain that all the distributor’s sites were already collapsing under the crushing load of a million souls crying out for a taste of berry-scented silicon&nbsp;pastry.</p>
<p>On the next day, I checked the sites again, and all the order pages were already closed. Either way, it wasn’t terribly useful for me because most of them didn’t support Paypal. Fast forward a veritable eternity, on June 16th, I was notified via email that <span class="caps">RS</span> Components that I would be allowed to order the device some time<a href="http://uk.rs-online.com/web/generalDisplay.html?id=raspberrypi&amp;file=questions#Queue"> in the near future</a>. Sure enough, on the 22nd, another email gave me a link to the order form, which I promptly filled out and I began the process of waiting. Not really, since I had other stuff to do and most of my interest had already vaporized at the daunting 7 weeks it was supposed to&nbsp;take.</p>
<p>Another eternity later, it arrived in some rather nice packaging. It actually came as a bit of a surprise, because I had become so accustomed to waiting that I had never really expected it to materialize so suddenly. But when it did, it was everything I imagined and more. It came in this rather nice cardboard box, which I eventually cut in half with an X-Acto knife (which nowadays, I use for all my paper splicing needs) to build a makeshift case. I fumbled around in a closet and found a neglected <span class="caps">16GB</span> SD card (probably back from the era when point-and-shoots were actually preferable to mobile phones) and installed that weird Debian distro (after having a little internal debate on what to install). But the first thing I had done was plugged it into a monitor through a HDMI-to-DVI converter. I took the charger from my Galaxy Nexus (I wasn’t using it for anything since I charge it in my room from my HP Touchpad Charger, and my Touchpad idly draining power from a cool inductive stand, the standardization of chargers is really pretty awesome), and used that as my Pi’s permanent power&nbsp;supply.</p>
<p>I also had a 2000mAh LiPo battery which I was going to use with my Arduino LilyPad for some cool foot-operated telegraph which I wanted to use as essentially a <span class="caps">UPS</span> for the Pi, but a bit of googling reveals that that might possibly entail actual electronicswork, so maybe that’s something for&nbsp;later.</p>
<p>I turned it on, and lo and behold it didn’t work. I actually never quite figured out why. Then, I tried plugging it into a really old 13 megaton <span class="caps">CRT</span> TV, which makes me realize how it’s sort of weird that the unit of megatons is hardly ever used for things other than atomic weapons, and now it feels oddly inappropriate for a hyperbole for the mass of a TV, but maybe it’s actually sort of appropriate because CRTs are <em>terrifying</em>. So analog seemed to work, except for this problem where my keyboard would keep repeating letters and not working well. That wasn’t a good&nbsp;start.</p>
<p>But after a little googling from my Chromebook, it turns out the keyboard issues came from the fact that I had plugged in my only spare <span class="caps">USB</span> keyboard which happened to be a Logitech Mouse+Keyboard+Speaker thing and my teensy Galaxy Nexus charger couldn’t eke out enough watts to power it. And the issue with the HDMI-to-DVI thing was just because I needed to restart with the cable plugged in. But neither of them posed a real material issue because I had been intending to use it as a headless rig from the&nbsp;start.</p>
<p>The first thing I really noticed was how surprisingly easy it was to install things. I had expected the <span class="caps">ARM</span> repositories to basically lack everything which might be useful, but it turns out that actually almost everything I wanted was available. I didn’t dare compiling anything, but <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node</a> (albeit a somewhat old version) was available from the repos, so I never really needed to. I had to manually update to a new version of <a href="https://npmjs.org/">npm</a>, but that wasn’t that bad. I set up <a href="https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever/">forever</a> to run a few apps, but not&nbsp;much.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons I could justify getting the Raspberry Pi however, was to run my <a href="http://antimatter15.com/wp/2012/05/visualizing-facebook-activity/">Facebook logging script</a> on something other than my main computer, and aside from getting confused trying to use sendxmpp, it was fairly&nbsp;straightforward.</p>

<p>So I was testing the responsiveness of the Samsung Series 5 Chromebook touchpad and made a short little script which basically continuously adds the mousewheel changes and draws them using canvas. But it appears that the trackpad does some kind of fitting to make things tend to be at right angles, though it’s not hard to get something diagonal or even somewhat&nbsp;circular.</p>

<p>So here’s a somewhat technical post, actually it’s pretty technical. But either way the premise is sort of simple to understand, and probably so is the context. I’m working on Swipe Gesture 2.0, which basically tries to take Chrome and Safari on <span class="caps">OS</span> X Lion’s awesome back-forward transitions and make them work on other operating systems. See, the thing is that multitouch isn’t _strictly _a requirement for it to work, a lot of computers just have the little bars on the bottom and right of the track bar (often with a little somewhat abrasive textured surface so you don’t accidentally tread upon it). Regardless, the title is a bit of a misnomer, because even though the event is called the “mousewheel”, it’s hardly meant to be observed from an actual mouse (or a wheel), instead it means the scrolling gesture on some kind of trackpad, either multitouch or&nbsp;not.</p>
<p>Well, first, I guess I’ll talk about the difference between how Lion and Leopard do it. The way Leopard did it was pretty cool but not particularly applicable to other platforms since it relied on the existence of a three-finger gesture. As in, you needed some kind of touchpad which was cool enough to support three-finger multiouch, <em>reliably</em>. It also behaved completely independent of the current zoom or scroll position, which makes implementation in software entirely trivial given access to some drivers which can recognize three fingers on a&nbsp;touchpad.</p>
<p>Lion did it a completely different way. Instead of creating an entirely new gesture which was entirely dedicated to the singular task of navigating through history, it conflated the notions of scrolling with navigating, which sort of makes sense. Apple’s quite dedicated to skeuomorphic metaphors, and they want to treat the web more like <em>literal pages</em>. A user can move it around to better keep certain things in view, and the physical movement to slide a sheet out of view is just an extension of that panning&nbsp;gesture.</p>
<p>However, technically this poses a completely different challenge, because this requires you to distinguish between scrolls and navigation requests. Scrolling is always the default behavior, but the navigation swipe gesture happens when scrolling wouldn’t actually result in anything. However, many implementations of scrolling are at least somewhat kinetic, often it’s emphasized in software (in the form of smooth-scrolling) or hardware (scroll wheels that don’t click but instead move basically freely) or because your arm has to obey the laws of kinematics (unless it doesn’t, in which case that’s certainly fascinating). So not only does the software have to determine when a mouse wheel action results manifests as a scroll, it has to see if it was the user’s intent to do the extraneous&nbsp;scrolling.</p>
<p>This is done by clustering the mouse wheel movements together temporally. Scroll events flow in in discrete chunks, and you can split events off into little buckets (in a sense), where if there isn’t any event sent within some arbitrary threshold (say, 500msecs or half a second), you stick stuff in a new bucket. This way, lets say you scroll from the top of the page to the bottom and you’re sort of excited, and spin the wheel as fast as possible, you hit the bottom of the page but it’s not some instant stop. You continue scrolling (because you’re just that excited, and just can’t stop) for a little bit more. Ignoring the fact that you probably won’t have a vertical/horizontal event handler (though there are some sort of intriguing possibilities for this, one idea is to have the upper threshold trigger full screen). Without segmenting them into certain buckets, it doesn’t recognize that the time when you’re ramming into the top of the page is part of the same general gesture as when you were scrolling, and it may interpret that as an intentional gesture. So that’s one part which makes it a bit more&nbsp;complex.</p>
<p>So now, you have these series of <code>mousewheel</code> events conveniently delimited into little gesture-chunks. The next part is determining whether or not the gesture-chunks are part of a scroll action or&nbsp;not.</p>
<p>Thankfully that’s a really simple thing to do. Just look at the document’s scrollTop and check if it’s zero (or scrollLeft for horizontal stuff) or whatever value is the width of the element. If it can’t scroll no more, then you have a winner and you can start the falling balloons and&nbsp;confetti.</p>
<p>Except it’s not that easy, because the document isn’t the only thing which can scroll. Thanks to the glory of <code>overflow:scroll</code>, there are lots of things which can scroll. Things which aren’t necessarily documents may be in arbitrary scroll positions to wreak havoc on your well-meaning&nbsp;heuristics.</p>
<p>So back to the drawing board, I guess. Actually, to think of it, maybe it’s simpler to listen for the <code>scroll</code> event, which fires when a scroll happens, and quite intuitively doesn’t fire when a scroll doesn’t happen. And mouse wheel actions always precede scroll ones (because the wheel events bubble and are cancelable, so you can prevent a scroll from happening). The only problem is that scroll events don’t bubble. As in, when a scroll event happens on some element, it’s not going to show up on the document, it’s only going to show up if you’re listening on that specific element at the right point in&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>The naive approach to this dilemma is just to attach a scroll listener to every single event on the document, and to reattach to some other elements whenever the <span class="caps">DOM</span> tree is modified in some way. This means the overhead grows rather significantly when pages are larger, in a way which could be likened to O(n) time where n represents the number of nodes in the document. If you want, you could lazily do it by attaching the scroll listener only once the wheel event has fired, but that would cause a significant delay when attempting to legitimately&nbsp;scroll.</p>
<p>Another thing you could do, is to make another assumption: that the element which gets scrolled has to be some parent of the element which the mouse is currently over. Making that assumption, we can add a <code>mousewheel</code> listener to the root of the document, as those kinds of events actually do bubble. And since they’re mouse events, once you capture it, you can get a <code>clientX</code> and <code>clientY</code>, comprising the current coordinates of the mouse. And with that, you can get the element immediately below the cursor with <code>document.elementFromPoint</code>. And since the scroll might fire on any one of the elements which are parents of the current element, you ascend up the tree and add a listener on all of those (until, of course you hit the document element, at which point you can’t go any further up). This yields performance which could essentially be modeled with O(log n), quite a bit better than&nbsp;O(n).</p>
<p>So now the finished process is fairly simple, you listen for a mousewheel event, and when it happens we determine the element, and ascend the tree, yada yada. That scroll listener, when fired, sets a global variable <code>lastDetectedScroll</code> to the current timestamp. We set a little temporary variable set to the before time and then we set a little timer, 150 milliseconds. It usually only takes like four to see if a scroll thingy happened, but let’s be safe by having an order-of-magnitude threshold. The Cuckoo clock rings, and we check if the <code>lastDetectedScroll</code> is the same thing, and if it is, it’s a swipe, and otherwise, it’s a&nbsp;scroll.</p>
