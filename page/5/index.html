              Hi. I’m <b>Kevin Kwok</b>, and I’m currently a sophomore at <b>MIT</b>, 
              and this is my obligatory online presence or whatever.  
            </p>
            <p>
              I regularly updated this site from 2007, when I started it in elementary school, 
              to summer 2014, when it was unwittingly absorbed into an international phishing ring.
            </p>
            <p>
              But like a phoenix, hydra or the national deficit, the site is back 
              again bigger than ever (after a rather long gestation period).
            </p>
            <p>
              For more obnoxious autobiographical content 
              blended with bits of nostalgia for the old PHP-on-sketchy-free-webhosting days, <a href="/about/">click here.</a>

<p>Okay, so I really want to maintain at least <a href="http://antimatter15.com/wp/2012/08/upcoming-changes/">one blog post per month</a>, and here I am, right before New Year’s with no apocalypse in sight to rapture me away from having to write a blog post. I don’t have anything particularly interesting ready to share, so here’s something fun that only took a few&nbsp;hours.</p>
<p>The rather long <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayeux_Tapestry">Bayeux tapestry</a> of an image I have crammed to the right marks the culmination of a series of rather odd tangents. It also serves as a reminder for me to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(Dante">abandon hope</a>#Overview_and_vestibule_of_Hell), because the shape of the conversation forces whatever post I plan on writing to be verbose enough as to fill all that vertical space so that the actual text here isn’t dwarfed by the image, which would be aesthetically&nbsp;jarring.</p>
<p>It all started the day before yesterday (I’m pretty sure it wasn’t actually then, but this is my abridged timeline and I’m entitled to indulge in whatever revisionist temptations I have as I’m writing this at a rather late hour, because 2013 is creeping closer at an uncomfortably fast rate and I still have some finite quantity of homework I haven’t attempted to start over the course of the past week), when my friend Robert realized that a rather significant portion of my chat responses include “wat”, “walp”, “lol”, “yeah”, “:P”, “cool”. From that, he logically sought to create a naive bayes predictor of me, because, why have a person nod in consent, when you can have a robot which can, to some degree of accuracy, automatically give that nod of assent without bothering a physical human&nbsp;being.</p>
<p>This isn’t quite the same thing as a traditional chat bot, because traditional chat bots don’t pretend to be actual people, largely because the state-of-the-art of artificial intelligence is quite a ways off from creating something which can suitably pass a Turing test, and even further away from being able to learn the entire knowledge of a person and provide an intelligent response to every imaginable stimulus. A closer approximation would be that this is a sort of semi-automated chat-macro system, whereby my generally useless responses of agreement are outsourced to a rudimentary script, fully capable of replicating my own rather unhelpful self. And from that it’s able to try to behave human by replicating a very very narrow subset of activity, deferring to a real human&nbsp;transparently.</p>
<p>It’s somewhat like how GMail has a <a href="http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=186531">priority inbox</a> feature which uses magical algorithms to separate the wheat from the chaff, diverting your attention away from the less subjectively important emails toward the few which actually matter. Except instead of giving the user ultimate discretion over the emails, this one would simply reply with&nbsp;“lol”.</p>
<p>It’s pretty easy to see any realistic application of this as rare. But I could totally be wrong, and I could be seeing this from totally the wrong angle. It’s entirely plausible that some subtle variant of this idea is absolutely brilliant, and will serve as the future of networked communication for decades to come. Maybe as email evolves the way of the Dodo, Instant Messaging will become the semi-permanent high-persistence low-immediacy ironic-initialism that <a href="https://medium.com/product-design/d8d4f2300cf3">takes email’s place</a>, and the  rest of the world becomes burn-on-reading SnapChats. Maybe SnapChat gets combined with lifelogging, and every minute of your life gets divided into four second snippets, and sent to one of your four thousand middle-school friends, so they can bask in the new hyper-intimate super-network, fueled by non-discretionary artificial intelligence&nbsp;filters.</p>
<p>That was Robert’s end anyway. He went on combing through our accumulated ~30,000 messages with his handy Mathematica trying to identify pertinent features which might probably replace me. On my side of the thing, I started with the userscript which would run on my browser to intercept the messages he sent, process them, and to send out a response, if a suitable automated one&nbsp;existed.</p>
<p>This actually turned out to be slightly more difficult than I had anticipated, for a single reason, and it was and has been the same reason that has bothered me for quite some time. Firing events. I really probably should learn how to use Selenium or something to automate things in a nice and clean&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>And that’s completely ignoring the five hundred pound trivial solution in the room, which isn’t to use a 500lb gorilla as a metaphor. Facebook supports <span class="caps">XMPP</span> which is a nice open source protocol with a billion implementations and it’s really not that hard to automate. I mean I’ve even done it before. <a href="http://antimatter15.com/wp/2012/08/raspberry-pi/">I have a Raspberry Pi</a> after all, and I can use it to run useless services like this, because I’ve decided that that’s exactly what a Raspberry Pi is for. But I didn’t and I have no idea why. C’est la vie, I&nbsp;guess.</p>
<p>The secret ended up being to Google a bunch of phrases related to keyboard-event-emitting with initializeKeyboardEvent or something of that sort a lot of times and stealing some code from StackOverflow. It took a few tries, but eventually something that worked emerged, and it was&nbsp;cool.</p>
<p>For posterity, this was the code that&nbsp;worked:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/4425144.js"></script>

<p>But that wasn’t the end of it. No, now there was a piece of code which could convincingly send a message, but it also had to read messages too. That wasn’t hard, actually, I just created a MutationObserver object and named it after a<a href="http://fringe.wikia.com/wiki/September"> Fringe character</a>. But then, presumably because Robert’s code was still training on that 30k message corpus, or something inexplicable, I built a crappy rudimentary thing with four or so simple regular expression based&nbsp;rules.</p>
<p>One of them happened to be that if someone were to send me the message “lol”, I would inexplicably respond as well with “lol”. This wasn’t initially a problem because the idea was to create a robotic version of <em>me</em> and _only _me. But Robert found it cool too so he ran the same script. Problem was, that this meant that if either one of us were to introduce the word “lol”, it would spiral nigh perpetually ad&nbsp;nauseam.</p>
<p>Somehow this sparked the idea to implement simple esoteric languages on it. The first one was a simple substitution rule. 0 -&gt; 1, 1 -&gt; 10. And over a few iterations it grew and took up huge amounts of&nbsp;space.</p>
<p>Next up was implementing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_system">tag system</a>. I implemented the 2-tag collatz sequence one. The cool thing is that it’s actually insanely easy to implement. You just take a sequence of symbols, strip the first two, and append the first symbol after you’ve transformed it according to a certain transformation&nbsp;mapping.</p>
<p>It was interesting as each little computation of this tiny esolang of a chat conversation involved a round trip of hundreds of miles. But each tag was still letters, ‘a’, ‘b’, and ‘c’. And it was getting late, and I thought that maybe it would be nice to hark back at inside-joke/theory of sorts that sparked it all. So I decided that our tags could be, instead of solitary letters, comprise word symbols like “lol”, “d:” and “wat”, which perhaps is a subconscious reference to an old webcomic that I had posted a while ago about a steganographic system built on internet&nbsp;vernacular.</p>
<p>I updated my script, posted it to him, he ran it, and initiated it all by saying “lol lol lol”. And from then the line lengths grew and shrank like mountainous terrain, eventually converging on the final state, a solitary “lol”. And for some inexplicable reason, some weird quirk of fate, or some deeper underlying truth to the universe, Robert always got the last “lol”. When I had tried it with a random initiating code, it would always terminate in some odd number of iterations, leaving me with the lowly penultimate&nbsp;laugh.</p>
<p>It sort of broke after that, and we didn’t fix&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there’s something incredibly cool about how an idea for something questionably turing-test-worthy can evolve into something&nbsp;turing-complete.</p>
<p>And that’s a basic summary of how uneventful my winter break has been, incidentally written with exactly 1337&nbsp;words.</p>

              <h2><a href="/2012/11/a-new-approach-to-video-lectures/">A New Approach to Video Lectures</a> <span class="subtitle">21 November 2012</span></h2>
            </header>
            <section class="content"><p>At time of writing, a video is being processed by my <code>v2.py</code> script, it’s only eight lines of code thanks to the beautifully terse nature of python and SimpleCV. And since it’s clearly not operating at the breakneck speed of one frame per second, I don’t have time to write this <span class="caps">README</span>, meaning that I’m writing this README. But since I haven’t actually put a description of this project out in writing before, I think it’s important to start off with an&nbsp;introduction.</p>
<p>It’s been over a year since I first wrote code for this project. It really dates back to late April 2011. Certainly it wouldn’t have been possible to write the processor in eight painless lines of python back then, when SimpleCV was considerably in more of an infancy. I’m pretty sure that puts the pre-production stage of this project in about the range of a usual Hollywood movie production. However, that’s really quite unusual for me because I don’t tend to wait to get started on projects often. Or at least, I usually publish something in a somewhat workable state before abandoning it for a&nbsp;year.</p>
<p>However, the fact is that this project has been dormant for more than an entire year. Not necessarily because I lost interest in it, but because it always seemed like a problem harder than I had been comfortable tackling at any given moment. There’s a sort of paradox that afflicts me, and probably other students (documented by that awesome Calvin and Hobbes comic) where at some point, you find a problem hard enough that it gets perpetually delayed until, of course, the deadline comes up and you end up rushing to finish it in some manner that only poses a vague semblance to the&nbsp;intent.</p>
<p>The basic premise is somewhat simple: videos aren’t usually the answer. That’s not to say video isn’t awesome, because it certainly is. YouTube, Vimeo and others provide an absolutely brilliant service, but those platforms are used for things that they aren’t particularly well suited for. Video hosting services have to be so absurdly general because there is this need to encompass every single use case in a content-neutral&nbsp;manner.</p>
<p>One particular example is with music, which often gets thrown on YouTube in the absence of somewhere else to stick it. A video hosting site is pretty inadequate, in part because it tries to optimize the wrong kinds of interactions. Having a big player window is useless, having an auto-hiding progress slider and having mediocre playback, playlist and looping interfaces are signs that a certain interface is being used for the wrong kind of content. Contrast this to a service like SoundCloud which is entirely devoted to the interacting with&nbsp;music.</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is somewhat similar. It’s to experiment with creating an interface for video lectures that goes above, in terms of interactivity and in terms of usability (perhaps even accessibility), what a simple video can&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>So yeah, that’s the concept that I came up with a year ago. I’m pretty sure it sounds like a pretty nice premise, but really at this point the old adage of “execution is everything” starts to come into play. How exactly is this going to be better than&nbsp;video?</p>
<p>One thing that’s constantly annoyed me about anything video-related is the little progress slider tracker thing. Even for a short video, I always end up on the wrong spot. YouTube has the little coverflow-esque window which gives little snapshots to help, and Apple has their drag down to do precision adjustment, but in the end the experience is far from optimal. This is especially unsuitable because moreso in lectures than perhaps in any other type of content, you really want to be able to step back and go over some little thing again. Having to risk cognitive derailment just to go over something you don’t quite get can’t possibly be good (actually, for long videos in general, it would be a good idea to snap the slider to the nearest camera/scene change which wouldn’t be hard to find with basic computer vision, since that’s in general, where I want to go). But for this specific application, the canvas itself makes perhaps the greatest navigatory tool of all. The format is just a perpetually amended canvas with redactions rare, and the most sensible way to navigate is by literally clicking on the region that needs&nbsp;explanation.</p>
<p>But having a linear representation of time is useful for pacing, and to keep track of things when there isn’t always a clear relationship between the position of the pen and time. A more useful system would have to be something more than just a solid gradient bar crawling across the bottom edge of the screen, because it would also convey where in the content the current step belongs. This is something analogous to the way YouTube shows a strip of snapshots when thumbing through the slider bar, but in a video-lecture setting we have the ability to automatically and intelligently build populate the strip with with specific and useful&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>From this foundation we can imagine looking at the entire lecture in it’s final end state, except with the handwriting grayed out. The user can simply circle or brush over the regions which might seem less trivial, and the interface could automatically stitch together a customized lecture at just the right pacing, playing back the work correlated with audio annotations. On top of that, the user can interact with the lecture by contributing his or her own annotations or commentary, so that learning isn’t confined to the course&nbsp;syllabus.</p>
<p>Now, this project, or at least its goals evolved from an idea to vectorize Khan Academy. None of these truly requires a vector input source, in fact many of the ideas would be more useful implemented with raster processing and filters, by virtue of having some possibility of broader application. I think it may actually be easier to do it with the raster method, but I think, if this is possible at all, it’d be cooler to do it using a vector medium. Even if having a vector source was a prerequisite, it’d probably be easier to patch up a little scratchpad-esque app to record mouse coordinates and to re-create lectures rather than fiddling with SimpleCV in order to form some semblance of a faithful reproduction of the&nbsp;source.</p>
<p>I’ve had quite a bit to do in the past few months, and that’s been reflected in the kind of work I’m doing. I guess there’s a sort of prioritization of projects which is going on now, and this is one of those which has perennially sat on the top of the list, unperturbed. I’ve been busy, and that’s led to this wretched mentality to avoid anything that would take large amounts of time, and I’ve been squandering my time on small and largely trivial problems (pun not&nbsp;intended).</p>
<p>At this point, the processing is almost done, I’d say about 90%, so I don’t have much time to say anything else. I really want this to work out, but of course, it might not. Whatever happens, It’s going to be&nbsp;something.</p>

            </header>
            <section class="content"><p><a href="/articles/2012/Introduction%20to%20the%20Pedant/IMG_20120924_231208.jpg"><div class="pic md" style="" ><img src="/articles/2012/Introduction%20to%20the%20Pedant/IMG_20120924_231208-300x224.jpg" alt="" ><div class="caption">IMG_20120924_231208</div></div></a></p>
<p>Recently, I’ve been racking up on hobbyist electronics components from <a href="http://sparkfun.com">Sparkfun</a>. Actually, this has been going on for quite a while, and most of that spending was justified by this project, which currently has the working name of the “pedant” (which is like at least a three-layered pun). I won’t say that it’s my very first foray into building some actual piece of hardware, but it’s probably the biggest and most original hardware project I’ve ever&nbsp;attempted.</p>
<p>I probably won’t be able to sell you on what it <em>is</em>, because it’s actually quite simple and uninteresting in principle. So instead of selling you on the cynical summary of its functionality, I’ll gild the concept with buzz words and try my very best to instill the same kind of enthusiasm I have for this project (which might just be because I haven’t done anything before with e-textiles or other electronics&nbsp;stuff).</p>
<p>The <strong>pedant is my foray into augmented reality, </strong>hopefully that means that it’s, at least some ways, original. It’s <strong>cheap</strong>, though actually in retrospect, not nearly as cheap as it <em>should</em> have been. And probably the most interesting aspect is that it skips through the whole perceived evolution of augmented reality from some bulky extremity into something sleek and unobtrusive. That’s not technically untrue, because the actual device will be fairly bulky, but it would exist in an already considerably bulky device (a shoe), so the <strong>net effect is that it’s sleek and unobtrusive</strong>.</p>
<p>I can’t say I was into that whole augmented reality thing before it was hip and cool. I only got interested in it fairly recently, likely due to somewhat high profile forays by Google and others. In mid-to-late 2008, I had just gotten my iPhone and I was <em>deeply</em> attached to it. At one point, I was on a vacation and at one point there was some arbitrary fact which came into question, at which point I pulled out my glorious first generation iPhone with its pristine anodized aluminium backing and loaded an app which searched an offline copy of all the textual content in the English Wikipedia (a concept which I had become so attached with that I ended up making Offline Wiki for the same reasons). And as the question was settled, the new subject of conversation was how incredible it is to keep all the world’s knowledge in a palm sized&nbsp;device.</p>
<p>But that’s not just an anecdote about the marvels of technology, it’s also a sad tale about how distracting it was. Somehow having access to that information allowed whatever <em>pedantic</em> instincts to prevail, shifting the conversation from a meaningful discussion into an artless digital query. And even forgiving that fact, it was slow and distracting, destroying the asynchronous exchange of ideas by creating this handheld bottleneck. Yes, we got an answer, but at what&nbsp;cost?</p>
<p>And I think that is a beautiful way to frame the argument for augmented reality. That whatever reality we have now is already being corrupted by the influence of the virtual world, and that only by willfully acknowledging that they both share the same space, can we start in the right direction of fixing it. That’s the direction Google’s Project Glass is headed, and I think that’s the right&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>The approach taken by the <a href="http://www.pranavmistry.com/projects/sixthsense/">SixthSense</a> project and by Google Glass mainly interacts with the user in a visual manner. And for the latter, there isn’t any really “good” and unobtrusive way to interact with that information. Both of the projects have extremely high output bandwidth (conveying information by projecting it into the user’s eye in one way or another), but limited input bandwidth and still fairly non-discreet (waving hands around to form shapes and sliding a bar on the frame, respectively). The Pedant takes a different approach by focusing on tactile input and output. This places the project more in the league of people who <a href="http://hackaday.com/2012/05/13/hacking-magnets-into-your-skin/">implant magnets under their skin</a> by hijacking the sense of touch to convey information about the&nbsp;surroundings.</p>
<p>It’s going to be a tiny device which fits within the dimensions of a shoe insole including an Arduino Pro, a Bluetooth Mate, an Accelerometer, 2000mAh LiPo battery, and three or more vibration motors. By tapping the foot (or by orienting it in slightly different ways) the user can input data in a manner similar to the telegraph. However, nothing necessarily restricts it to being sent through a single “stream”, so it could end up more like a chorded telegraph (a la <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorded_keyboard">chorded keyboard</a>). The great thing is that with chording, it becomes much more practical to receive information at reasonable&nbsp;rates.</p>
<p>Just like how a cell phone can vibrate to signal that the user has been left a message, the pedant would be used primarily to handle notifications, but rather than indistinguishable general sensations on the thigh, it’ll portray the type of notifications as well as the content, and the user even has the possibility to respond without changing the&nbsp;environment.</p>
<p>Without weird tactile abstract character sets, the Pedant could be interesting just as a sort of social network where users can feel the presence of other users in their general vicinity. It could monitor the footsteps of all nearby Pedant wearers and as it’s connected via a cellular data network and a smartphone <span class="caps">GPS</span> to trigger the specific vibration motors to evoke an awareness of how fast they’re walking and what general direction they are. In a sense, a social network of&nbsp;pedometers.</p>

<p>I haven’t been particularly raving about Hostmonster for the near two years I’ve been a customer of their’s, and it’s time for a change. In the past week, I moved to a new web host. As of this moment, I’m using Bitcable, specifically the cheapest shared plan plus another discount. I’ve had my share of gripes about the service, but speed and reliability so far have not been among them. I discovered Bitcable through a friend who knew a friend who operated a web host, well, primarily a <span class="caps">VPS</span> service. Over a fair amount of begging for a VPS discount, I decided to try out their (I always find it awkward when referring to companies or services as a plural in spite of knowledge that it’s pretty much a one-man-show, but that makes it all the more impressive) shared plan, since that was analogous whatever I was paying for with Hostmonster. And anyway, for $2/mo, how bad can it&nbsp;get?</p>
<p>That question was a tad misleading, so far, Bitcable’s pretty awesome. Part of the thing about using a service from a friend-of-a-friend (<span class="caps">FOAF</span>, if I ever need to use an acronym later on in this post, but I’ll keep it here just because it’s a fun thing to say) is that you can get some pretty good support over some random communication channels. It’s small enough that he doesn’t oversell, and the performance really shows&nbsp;through.</p>
<p>I did, however have some issues with the configuration of the server. The first issue is that by default, shared customers don’t get <span class="caps">SFTP</span> access. That’s pretty annoying because I’ve recently fallen in love with passwordless login using public keys. I sent an angry support ticket and it was enabled soon enough. But a much more pressing issue was that soon after my migration, there was some long server outage due to some power supply failure (which thankfully, since it took over a month to write this post which is more indicative of the bad state that my blog is in than the host, hasn’t happened again, I haven’t noticed a minute of downtime since then and I’ve set uptime monitors to ensure&nbsp;that).</p>
<p>So yeah, I’ll be on this host for the foreseeable&nbsp;future.</p>
