              Hi. I’m <b>Kevin Kwok</b>, and I’m currently a sophomore at <b>MIT</b>, 
              and this is my obligatory online presence or whatever.  
            </p>
            <p>
              I regularly updated this site from 2007, when I started it in elementary school, 
              to summer 2014, when it was unwittingly absorbed into an international phishing ring.
            </p>
            <p>
              But like a phoenix, hydra or the national deficit, the site is back 
              again bigger than ever (after a rather long gestation period).
            </p>
            <p>
              For more obnoxious autobiographical content 
              blended with bits of nostalgia for the old PHP-on-sketchy-free-webhosting days, click here.

            <section class="content"><p><a href="/articles/2014/Unwarranted%20Speculation%20On%20Oculus%20VR/oculus-rift-crystal-cove-100245805-orig_clipped_rev_2.png"><div class="pic md" style="" ><img src="/articles/2014/Unwarranted%20Speculation%20On%20Oculus%20VR/oculus-rift-crystal-cove-100245805-orig_clipped_rev_2-300x237.png" alt="oculus-rift-crystal-cove-100245805-orig_clipped_rev_2" ></div></a></p>
<p>I’m almost certainly an outsider, so I can’t speak for the gaming or <span class="caps">VR</span> communities, but to me the Facebook acquisition (and the <a href="/2014/03/unwarranted-speculation-on-oculus-vr/www.oculusvr.com/blog/introducing-michael-abrash-oculus-chief-scientist/">Abrash onboarding announcement</a>) signals that the new Oculus is more interested in bringing to fruition the Metaverse from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash">Snow Crash</a>, and that the hardware (Rift <span class="caps">DK1</span>, Crystal Cove, DK2, etc.) has been reduced to a mere means to attaining that&nbsp;end.</p>
<p>I think the “original” product was always contextualized as a gaming accessory, as the vested (financial, by virtue of <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1523379957/oculus-rift-step-into-the-game">Kickstarter</a>) interest was held by gamers hoping to utilize this new form factor and&nbsp;experience.</p>
<p>I guess the question is what exactly is Oculus? In the beginning, I’d venture that the answer was simple. They were building a head mounted display which would be affordable, leveraging the technological improvements of the past decade (cheap high quality displays meant for phones and tablets, faster graphics cards). The hardware was their concern, and the software, the games and experiences, everyone&nbsp;else’s.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gaqQdyfAz8">QuakeCon Abrash-Carmack-Luckey</a> panel (which may be a bit dated), Carmack admits that he isn’t really interested in developing the hardware, as opposed to Luckey whose passion really lies in developing that hardware. Carmack, Abrash, and ultimately Facebook are alike in that they are <em>software</em> titans, which I think really shifts the balance in terms of the intentions for&nbsp;Oculus.</p>
<p>Sure there’s the hardware aspect, which is far from a solved problem. But given the palpable progress of Crystal Cove and the famed Valve prototypes, the end is nigh (to be less melodramatic, the consumer edition is on the brink of happening). But if you look at the teardowns, it’s a tablet screen, <span class="caps">LEEP</span> optics, an inertial measurement unit, and infrared tracker. The underlying display technology isn’t going to get better, because it’s already piggybacking off a much larger market where even Facebook’s considerable budget is a drop in the&nbsp;bucket.</p>
<p>I think since Carmack joined Luckey’s shop, the destiny of Oculus has shifted from producers of a mere display commodity to a more vertically integrated entity which develops both the hardware and the software which drives its progress and adoption (a la&nbsp;Apple).</p>
<p>And that accumulation of software talent is, I think, itself, a credible threat to the game developers hoping to build games for the Rift- because it establishes a first party, and that has the risk of pushing third party developers into the realm of the second class&nbsp;citizen.</p>
<p>But this dynamic of conflicted interest has played out several times before, and it is not usually an <em>existential</em> risk to the third parties. With transitions flipped, Microsoft had to deal with the risk of alienating OEMs when it started developing its own hardware- the Surface tablet. Likewise, Google’s decision to develop Nexus tablets and phones (and the acquisition of Motorola Mobility) was criticized because it would inevitably result in favoritism for its own devices, weakening relationships between <span class="caps">LG</span>, HTC, Samsung and the&nbsp;ilk.</p>
<p>The risk in stifling competition is inherent in any kind of move involving integration (horizontal, vertical, or 37 degrees counterclockwise), but on the other hand, this dissolution of the separation of interests enables the unimpeded progress toward a coherent&nbsp;vision.</p>
<p>And I think that coherent vision is to construct Virtual Reality that is truly grand, world-encompassing and liable to all the philosophical depth missing from prior incarnations outside of science fiction. Not the kind of gimmicky interactions retrofitted into first person shooters, jumping onto the bandwagon represented by that euphemistic initialism&nbsp;“<span class="caps">VR</span>”.</p>
<p>I don’t think post-acquisition institutional independence or agency ultimately matter, because the seeds for something larger has already been&nbsp;sown.</p>
<p>Is this new Oculus a threat to existing companies and their efforts to build <span class="caps">VR</span> games? Perhaps, this has to be true on some level, the more interesting question, I think, is whether or not this cost will be offset (and then some) by those inspired by Oculus’s vision and audacity and that which can be built on this new and boundless&nbsp;meta-platform.</p>
<hr>
<p><small>
..so I just finished writing all of this. I originally meant it as a Hacker News comment, and then halfway through I decided not to ultimately submit it, because if you really think about it, this is all kind of silly. I feel like one of those poor conspiracy theorists connecting dots where the lines may not exist. I’m sure there are nontrivial technical challenges that still need to be vanquished, but as an outside observer, I’d claim that Dunning-Kruger permeates my perception, and I can’t possibly gauge the extent of problems that remain (the less you know, the simpler it all seems). And I have a habit of conflating long term with short term (when I was 12, I vowed not to learn to drive, because surely, aeons from then, when I turned 16, the cars would no doubt drive themselves). </small><small>I mean, I wrote all of this like five minutes ago, it can’t be _that _wrong already, right?</small></p>

<p><em>Work expands so as to fill the time available for its&nbsp;completion.</em></p>
<p>— Parkinson’s&nbsp;Law</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the past four or so months, I’ve been working on just one major project. It’s rather depressing to think that I built a reasonably impressive initial prototype over the course of about a dozen sleep-deprived hours, and that all I’ve accomplished since then is minor polish. Technically, there have been at least two rewrites, completely new capabilities and substantially improved technology, but none of that really matters when it comes to describing the project. A project is what it is, at 80% completion, at 95% and&nbsp;99%.</p>
<p>Second semester at school has started, and that means that Pass/No Record isn’t a thing anymore, and everyone else is adjusting their behavior appropriately. Problem is, <em>I</em> haven’t changed. It turns out that an entire semester of racing toward the bottom is unsustainable when suddenly the floor has been adjusted to above your current position. But the more important point is that it’s leaving less time, and in particular, less contiguous time to work on&nbsp;anything.</p>
<p>Last month, I was working on a port of the Telea inpainting algorithm. Inpainting refers to any kind of image processing operation which attempts to intelligently fill in certain regions of an image with other content. Perhaps the most famous implementation of this is Photoshop’s Content Aware Fill feature, which uses a texture-synthesis and patch-based system, which enables them to copy over things like patterns, and textures, filling in vast contiguous regions of missing content. The problem is patch-based inpainting is almost always quite slow, in spite of its high quality results. There are simpler algorithms based on the Fast Marching Method like Telea or Navier-Stokes which use diffusion models and the ilk in order to propagate the solid colors of the bordering region of some inpainting mask inwards. I’ll write an actual blog post about this once I package it up and build a nifty demo for&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Last year, Ben Kamens of Khan Academy posted about reverse engineering the flyout menu in Amazon, which suffered from the rather odd behavior of <em>acting exactly how it should</em>. You totally should be able to navigate to a submenu without worrying about accidentally mousing over something else. I looked around for a context menu library which could actually do this, but for some reason I couldn’t find one, so I decided to make my&nbsp;own.</p>

            <section class="content"><p><a href="/articles/2014/HeapQueue.JS/heap.png"><div class="pic md" style="" ><img src="/articles/2014/HeapQueue.JS/heap-300x222.png" alt="heap" ></div></a></p>
<p>I have a <a href="https://github.com/antimatter15/ocrad.js">habit</a> of writing blog posts in <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text</a> in lieu of legitimate READMEs. This <a href="https://github.com/antimatter15/heapqueue.js">project</a> was simple and short enough that I think I did manage to write something with a passable semblance to a<a href="https://github.com/antimatter15/heapqueue.js/blob/master/README.md"> functional <span class="caps">README</span></a> before initiating this quest to craft a blog&nbsp;post.</p>
<p>This is hardly a project that I’d expect to go down in the annals of my blog as particularly interesting or notable. Instead, it’s a rather boring low-level <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure">computer sciencey thingy</a>) who would feel perfectly comfortable amidst homework&nbsp;assignments.</p>
<p>In fact, it’s virtually assured that documenting this endeavor– the combination of writing the words which comprise this post and the documentation already written on how to use this rather simple library– will inevitably consume more of my time than actual coding (people who are more familiar with highly intricate professional software tapestries may claim that such is merely the ideal and typical experience of a&nbsp;programmer).</p>
<p>Notice that I’ve managed to spend three paragraphs (well, my paragraphs are on the order of two sentences, so it doesn’t even qualify for the fourth-grade definition for what a paragraph is) talking about the uninteresting character of the project, its relative diminutive size, and the process of writing about the subject, without actually describing what exactly the project is. This, more than perhaps any other project of mine deserves such a diversion, for it is unlikely to yield<a href="/articles/2014/HeapQueue.JS/vQvAaGW.jpg"> “much amaze”</a> or even a modest <a href="/articles/2014/HeapQueue.JS/tumblr_mtsg23ehsy1sjf3who1_500.jpg">“such wow”</a>.</p>
<p>It is a binary heap priority queue, a teensy bit shy of 50 lines, a mere kilobyte minified. It’s very loosely based off of Adam Hooper’s <a href="https://github.com/adamhooper/js-priority-queue">js-priority-queue</a> but considerably&nbsp;smaller.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve gotten the actual informative and useful part of the blog post off my shoulders, I can take you along for the unproductive plunge into the rather lame backstory for the project. I was working on a port of the <a href="http://iwi.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/root/2004/JGraphToolsTelea/2004JGraphToolsTelea.pdf">Telea</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpainting">inpainting</a> algorithm and needed a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue">priority queue</a>, because the little incremental<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort"> insertion sort</a> that I hacked together in two lines was taking a few orders of magnitude longer than was&nbsp;acceptable.</p>
<p>With my considerable Google-Fu, I searched “javascript heap queue” and found <a href="https://github.com/adamhooper/js-priority-queue">js-priority-queue</a> as well as <a href="https://github.com/STRd6/priority_queue/tree/master">PriorityQueue.js</a>. They both happened to be implemented in <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>, which <a href="https://github.com/neotenic/protobowl">I love</a>, except not really. I like the syntax, but creating a project using it usually involves setting up some compilation pipeline in order to get it to do the things that I want it to do. Overall, it’s a bit too much of a hassle for little&nbsp;projects.</p>
<p>I couldn’t actually find the source code for PriorityQueue.js so I settled for js-priority-queue. It was a bit annoying in that it required <a href="http://requirejs.org/">require.js</a> to function and included several storage strategies that were totally useless. So I copied and pasted a few files together and stripped it of its <a href="http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html"><span class="caps">AMD</span></a> dependencies and created a somewhat dieted&nbsp;version.</p>
<p>But as 9th grade World History teaches us, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeasement">appeasement</a> never works, and this purely pragmatic minification leads inexorably to an irrational <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf">code golfing</a>. At that point, I was overcome by this undeniable urge to cleanse it further, perhaps blinded by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">not-invented-here syndrome</a> and software anorexia. Minutes later the file had been laid waste and in its place there existed its <a href="https://github.com/antimatter15/heapqueue.js/blob/master/heapqueue.js">bare skeletal remains</a>.</p>
<p>Now all I need to do is push it to <a href="https://github.com/antimatter15/heapqueue.js">github</a> and write a blog&nbsp;post…</p>

<p>As with any minor stepping stone on the road to hell relentless trajectory of     <link />Atwood’s Law, I probably don’t need to justify the existence of yet another “x, but now in Javascript!”, but I might as well try. After all, we all would like to think that there’s some ulterior motive to fulfilling that&nbsp;prophesy.</p>
<p>On tablet or other touchscreen devices- of which there are quite a number of nowadays (as the New Year’s Eve post, I am obliged to include conjecture about the technological zeitgeist), a library such as Ocrad.js might be used to add handwriting input in a device and operating system agnostic manner. Oftentimes, capturing the strokes and sending them over to a server to process might entail unacceptably high latency. Maybe you’re working on an offline-capable note-taking app, or a browser extension which indexes all the doge memes that you stumble upon while prowling the dark corners of the&nbsp;internet.</p>
<p>If you’ve been following my trail of blog posts recently, you’d probably be able to tell that I’ve been scrambling to finish the program that I prototyped many months ago overnight at a Hackathon. The idea of the extension was kind of simple and also kind of magical: a browser extension that allowed users to highlight, copy, and paste text from any image as if it were plain text. Of course the implementation is a bit difficult and actually relies on the advent of a number of newfangled&nbsp;technologies.</p>
<p>If you try to search for some open source text recognition engine, the first thing that comes up is Tesseract. That isn’t a mistake, because it turns out that the competition is worlds away in terms of accuracy. It’s actually pretty sad that the state of the art hasn’t progressed substantially since the&nbsp;mid-nineties.</p>
<p>A month ago, I tried compiling Tesseract using Emscripten. Perhaps it was a bad thing to try first, but soon I learned that even if it did work out, it probably wouldn’t have been practical anyway. I had figured that all <span class="caps">OCR</span> engines had been powered by artificial neural networks, support vector machines, k-nearest-neighbors and their machine learning kin. It turns out that this is hardly the norm except in the realm of the actually-accurate, whose open source provinces live under the protection of Lord&nbsp;Tesseract.</p>
<p><span class="caps">GOCR</span> and Ocrad are essentially the only other open source OCR engines (there’s technically also Cuneiform, but the source code is in a really really big zip file from some website in Russian and its also really slow according to benchmarks). And something I didn’t realize until I had peered into the source code is that they are powered by (presumably) painstakingly written rules for each and every detectable glyph and variation. This kind of blew my&nbsp;mind.</p>
<p>Anyway, I tried to compile <span class="caps">GOCR</span> first and was immediately struck by how easy and painless it had been. I was on a roll, and decided to do Ocrad as well. It wasn’t particularly hard- sure it was slightly more involved but still hardly&nbsp;anything.</p>
<p><span class="caps">GOCR</span> and Ocrad both only operate on NetPBM files (supporting other files is done in typical unix fashion by piping the outputs from programs that convert file formats). Nobody really uses NetPBM anymore, so in order to handle a typical use case, I’d need some means of converting from raw pixel values into the format. I Googled around for Javascript implementations of PBM/PGM/PNM, finding nothing. I opened the Wikipedia page on the format and was pleased to found out why: the format is dirt&nbsp;simple.</p>
<p>If you know me in person, you’ll probably know that I’m not a terribly decisive person. Oftentimes, I’ll delay the decision until there isn’t a choice left for me to make. Anyway, serially-indecisive-me strikes again, so I alternated between the development of <span class="caps">GOCR</span>.js and Ocrad.js, leading up to a simultaneous&nbsp;release.</p>
<p>But in the back of my mind, I knew that eventually I would have to pick one for building my image highlighting project. I had been leaning toward Ocrad the whole time because it seemed to be a bit faster and more accurate when it came to&nbsp;handwriting.</p>
<p>Anyway, I spent a while building the demo page. It’s pretty simple but I wouldn’t describe it as ugly. There’s a canvas in the center which can be drawn to in arbitrary fonts pulled via the Google Font <span class="caps">API</span>. There’s a neat little thing which lets you draw things on the canvas. And to round out the experience, you can run the OCR engine on your own images, by loading the image file onto canvas to support any file the browser does (JPG, GIF, BMP, WebP, PNG, SVG) or by directly feeding the engine in its native NetPBM&nbsp;formats.</p>
<p>What consistently amazes me about Optical Character Recognition isn’t its astonishing quality or lack thereof. Rather, it’s how utterly unpredictable the results can be. Sometimes there’ll be some barely legible block of text that comes through absolutely pristine, and some other time there will be a perfectly clean input which outputs complete garbage. Maybe this is a testament to the sheer difficulty of computer vision or the incredible and under-appreciated abilities of the human visual&nbsp;cortex.</p>
<p>At one point, I was talking to someone and I distinctly remembered (I know, all the best stories start this way) a sense of surprise when the person indicated that he had heard of Tesseract, the open source <span class="caps">OCR</span> engine. I had appraised it as somewhat more obscure than it evidently was. Some time later, I confided about the incident with a friend, and he said something along the lines of “OCR is one of those fields that everyone comes across&nbsp;once”.</p>
<p>I guess I’ve kind of held onto that thought for a while now, and it certainly seems to have at least a grain of truth. Text embedded into the physical world is more or less our primary means we have for communication and expression. Technology is about building tools that augment human capacity and inevitably entails supplanting some human capability. Data input is a huge bottleneck, and while we’re kind of sidestepping the problem with things like <span class="caps">QR</span> codes by bringing the digital world into the physical. OCR is just one of those fundamental enabling technologies which ought to be as broad in scope as the set of humans who have interacted with a&nbsp;keyboard.</p>
<p>I can’t help but feel that the rather large set of people who have interacted with the problem character recognition have surveyed the available tools and reached the same conclusion as your miniature Magic 8 Ball desk ornament: “Try again later”. It doesn’t take long for one to discover an instance of perfectly crisp and legible type which results in line noise of such entropy that it’d give DUAL_EC_DRBG a run for its money. “No, there really isn’t any way for this to be the state of the art.” “Well, I guess if it is, then maybe it’ll improve in a few years- technology improves quickly,&nbsp;right?”</p>
<p>You would think that some analogue of Linus’s Law would hold true: “given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow”- especially if you’re dealing with literal eyeballs reading letters. But incidentally, the engine that absolutely everyone uses was developed three decades ago (It’s older than I am!), abandoned for a decade before being acquired and released to the world (by our favorite benevolent overlords,&nbsp;Google).</p>
<p>In fact, what’s absolutely stunning is the sheer universality of Tesseract. Just about everything which claims to have text recognition as a feature is backed by it. At one point, I was hoping that Mathematica had some clever routine using morphology and symbolic new kinds of sciences and evolved automata pattern recognition. Nope! Nestled deep within the gigabytes of code lies the Chuck Testa of textadermies:&nbsp;Tesseract.</p>

<p>If the frequency of these progress reports is to say anything, it’s that I’m terrible at sticking to a schedule and even worse at estimating progress. I was hoping that I’d be able to use the Thanksgiving break in order to be productive and get ahead of my various projects– in particular, getting the text-detection and <span class="caps">OCR</span> extension to a state complete enough to&nbsp;publish.</p>
<p>For the past few days I’ve been playing with writing a minimal cryptocurrency which incorporates the central innovation of Bitcoin— the hashcash based transaction chain. It’s a simple enough concept that I could manage to implement the core functionality in about a hundred lines of&nbsp;Coffeescript.</p>
<p>I’m also working on a cute little alarm clock which incorporates a pressure sensor underneath my bed in lieu of a snooze button. The goal is to use it as a framework for novel approaches to the tried and true problem of getting undergrads to wake up at ungodly hours (anything before noon). It’s powered by an Arduino and <span class="caps">I2C</span> ChronoDot and a large 7-segment&nbsp;display.</p>
<p>I’ve laid a little ethernet cable from the side of my bed, along the ceiling and to the door which contains a bunch of little <span class="caps">EL</span> wire inverter boxes (I’m smothering the transformers with Sugru in order to hopefully dampen the onset of my acoustically-induced&nbsp;insanity).</p>
