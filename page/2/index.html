              Hi. I’m <b>Kevin Kwok</b>, and I’m currently a junior at <b>MIT</b>, 
              and this is my obligatory online presence or whatever.  
            </p>
            <p>This is my little corner of the internet, where I talk about random projects and ideas and stuff. </p>

<p>This is my submission to blogdom’s burgeoning class of eternally “work in progress” sites. I’ve been working on this blog reboot for nearly a year at this point (rest assured, I haven’t worked on it for any appreciable fraction of that time— but it’s nonetheless traumatizing for me as “blog posts written” is my primary metric for personal&nbsp;productivity). </p>
<p>There’s still a lot left to be done, but right now it should be in a more or less functional and navigable state. I’ve just added image thumbnailing (so this homepage shouldn’t take a triassic aeon to load anymore), which seems like an addition substantial-enough to warrant some new words adorning the featured post&nbsp;callout.</p>
<p>Most importantly though, it’s now a hip static site hosted on Github Pages (though I might move to S3), so the Turkish phishers last remaining venue for hijacking this site may be sending a pull&nbsp;request. </p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<h3 id="getting-hacked">Getting&nbsp;Hacked</h3>
<p><a href="/2014/06/blog-hacked/"><div class="pic md right" style="width: 300px" ><img alt=""  src="/articles/2015/Blog%20Reboot/paypal-medium.jpg" ><div class="caption">I unwittingly invited some consultants work on the new blog design, but all they could come up with was clearly somewhat unoriginal&#8230;</div></div></a></p>
<p>I don’t generally pay a lot of attention to this blog— especially during the beginning of every month. I used to generally hold myself to a rule that I would post something new at least once a month, but that policy kept slipping and then there was a mad dash to finish some blog post the first or second day of each new month to be retroactively&nbsp;timestamped. </p>
<p>Anyway, point is that I didn’t notice when the site got hacked for a few days. Unfortunately I don’t have any screenshots of what the site looked like when it was hacked. And at this point I can’t promise you that my mental model of what it looked like is anything more than a&nbsp;hallucination. </p>
<p>It’s a bit of an interesting chapter in my blog’s history, so I’ve spun off this section <a href="/2014/06/blog-hacked/">into its own post</a>.</p>
<h3 id="first-sketches">First&nbsp;Sketches</h3>
<p><div class="pic md right" style="width: 200px" ><img alt=""  src="/articles/2015/Blog%20Reboot/firstsketch-medium.jpg" ></div></p>
<p>I guess it makes a reasonable amount of sense to write about how this site works. This is the first incarnation of the blog which is to any appreciable extent aesthetically original. It isn’t the default theme of JupiterCMS, PHPFusion, nor is it a free template for&nbsp;Wordpress. </p>
<p>It’s a pretty simple design, and it’s pretty nifty that in this day and age, a design which is sparse by ignorance is indestinguishable from a good design which is sparse by (uh) design. There isn’t much besides the simple arrangement of rectangles and lines and it relies pretty heavily on typography and whitespace to delimit&nbsp;sections. </p>
<p>At around the same time my blog stopped working, I came into the posession of a Moleskine. On June 14th, apparently, I started my first sketch of what my blog might be&nbsp;like. </p>
<p><div class="pic md right" style="width: 200px" ><img alt=""  src="/articles/2015/Blog%20Reboot/ideas-medium.jpg" ></div></p>
<p>In retrospect, it didn’t really look very coherent and I have literally no idea what I was trying to do at the time. But one of the motivations behind the entire endeavor was to strike a sort of balance between a blog and a portfolio. I like the idea of documenting the process of things and writing some part of the though process a somewhat non-abbreviated form. But one thing that I noticed is that a blog is a terrible means of surfacing older content, and I think a lot of the interesting ideas I’ve explored are the ones which I played around with several years&nbsp;ago. </p>
<p>On the other spectrum, I didn’t want to go too far in the direction of summary. I didn’t quite want it to be simply a résumé where I condense every endeavor into two buzzword-packed sentences which summarize the little iota of cleverness imbued in the&nbsp;project. </p>
<p>And so the motivation of the design was finding some way to hybridize the two goals— summary and&nbsp;process. </p>
<p>I found another sketch in my Moleskine dated June 24th, which seems to be a bit more coherent. On the right you can see some blocks and lines which, while not having much bearing on the current site design, at least seem like they might pass a Turing test criterion for sufficiently-websiteish&nbsp;website.</p>
<p>One thing that I noticed is that the sequence of my projects tends to be pretty structured. Over the years, I tend to explore little ideas which tend to culminate into singular projects— or alternatively, I build a larger project and spin off smaller components. All of this tends to happen over a relatively short time period (a few months to a&nbsp;year). </p>
<p>So in terms of a projects list, this means that I can introduce a bit of an aesthetic cadence where a series of minor projects are occasionally punctuated by larger projects. And because of this natural faux-hierarchy there’s a natural clustering which is generally both temporal and subjective. The short projects have single-sentence summaries, whereas the larger projects can have a paragraph worth of&nbsp;elaboration.</p>
<p>Naturally, all the project descriptions are hyperlinked and lead to a project page which includes all the blog posts documenting the process of creating that particular&nbsp;project. </p>
<h3 id="new-tools">New&nbsp;Tools</h3>
<p>At some point I helped design a mobile app and ended up getting reasonably familiar with Adobe&nbsp;Illustrator. </p>
<p>It was also at this time that I started using tools that designers use— things like <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html">Adobe Illustrator</a> and <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Bohemian Coding’s Sketch</a>. </p>

<p>I guess it’s a trivia site and I’m never actually going to legitimately finish this <span class="caps">README</span>, as it’s substantially over 3,000 words and I haven’t even finished the introduction to the prequel. I might as well distill the whole thing down to what actually matters— the little bits of trivia that really don’t matter but might be amusing to some people with particularly derranged senses of&nbsp;amusement.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The official about page says that Protobowl is a portmanteau of “Prototype Quizbowl Application”, but this is in fact a lie. It is in fact and has always been an acronym for Promoting Racism Online To Obstruct Better Organized World Leadership. It was always designed to be nothing less than a <a href="http://www.qbwiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Protobowl&amp;oldid=22538">“literal cancer of the quizbowl community”</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Protobowl’s live-as-you-type real time chat was inspired by Google Wave, which Kevin is quite embarassed to have spent the first half of high school playing with, almost as embarrassed as he feels right now writing about himself in third&nbsp;person.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Protobowl was going to have a social component (called Socialbowl) so that users could log in and view their scores and detailed performance stats with graphs depicting buzz rates per category. Ben stopped working on it before it launched, so it was never&nbsp;added.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Protobowl runs primarily on Nodejitsu, but falls back to a Bitcable <span class="caps">VPS</span>, and then to an MIT XVM if all hell breaks loose. In late 2012, Ben and I had a bet over whether or not he would get into the Science Honor Society, and whoever lost would have to pay for the operational costs of Protobowl for the rest of time. He got accepted and lost the&nbsp;bet.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For a long time (and probably still today, albeit hopefully less so), Protobowl suffered from a mysterious lag problem that we could never quite figure out. In the process of debugging it, we instituted a bunch of voodoo superstitious policies under semi-credible conjectures. For the possibility that it might be due to increasing memory pressure due to a small memory leak, Protobowl restarts every day at 4am <span class="caps">EST</span> every day. The time was chosen because it represents the time of day with the fewest online&nbsp;users.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Protobowl has a built-in chat bot which is the remanant of a chat bot I had built in middle school for Omegle. It can be triggered by going into any empty room and saying (in chat) “I’m lonely”. It’s mostly reflective of the hornier, angstier and shallower side of online chat rooms, so it’s unlikely to pass a turing test (even if it decides to answer “asl” with “18 f&nbsp;uk”. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Protobowl was made using Twitter Bootstrap, which for quite a while was the blandest theme you could find on the internet because everyone who couldn’t design thought it looked beautiful. But now Bootstrap has itself become enamored with flat design, and Protobowl looks clean and original again with its soft gradients and gentle rounded&nbsp;corners. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Protobowl stores active rooms in-memory as simple Javascript objects. Inactive rooms are saved in a MongoDB database so that they can be unfrozen when requested. Questions are stored in an entirely separate MongoDB&nbsp;database. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="version-3">Version&nbsp;3</h2>
<p>The current version of Protobowl which lies before you is the “third” version. By that, I mean these version numbers don’t mean much more than significant changes to the core of protobowl. Version 3 constituted more or less an entire rewrite to the codebase with specific attention paid to offline-first and abstracting away the socket layer. The result is something which is, at least architecturally, pretty cool. A rather large amount of code is shared between client and server, such that the transition between online and offline and back is super&nbsp;seamless.</p>
<h1 id="readme-anachronisms"><span class="caps">README</span> <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;Anachronisms</h1>
<p>Okay, so I think <span class="caps">NPM</span> would complain if I didn’t have a readme, so I guess I’ll start writing something which might be mistaken for a readme given a certain number of prior conditions. As you might figure out in the “Prototype Quizbowl Application” section, the core of protobowl has evolved significantly during the life of this readme, and especially because I’m so insistent on writing pseudo-literary fluff in lieu of helpful concise manuals and bullets, there’s a good chance that the vast majority of the readme will be rife with anachronisms, statements that once were true, were falsified, returned to truthfulness and then fell into a stasis of&nbsp;untruth. </p>
<h1 id="manual">Manual</h1>
<p>Okay, so this application probably ranks among one of the largest things I’ve ever done, which actually does say something as to its scope. However, it’s still designed to be fast and responsive and what&nbsp;not.</p>
<p>But it’s got a somewhat large scope which makes me believe that it may be useful to have a sort of overview not of how things work (that’s what the code is for), but a somewhat deeper look into what it does. What kinds of features and little&nbsp;tricks.</p>
<h2 id="responsive-design">Responsive&nbsp;Design</h2>
<p>Yeah, yeah, buzzwords galore. It’s responsively designed which means that it should, at least in theory, work on all screen sizes, from gigantic monitor walls of 60 <span class="caps">HD</span> displays (I’ve only tested the application on six WXQGA monitors) to an iPhone screen (I won’t venture any smaller, because running on watches represents a significant effort beyond what I already&nbsp;have).</p>
<p>It’s been tested on a few browsers, Chrome (on Linux, Windows, iPad, Galaxy Nexus) and Firefox and Safari on&nbsp;iPad. </p>
<p>It’s built with Twitter Bootstrap, sans fugly black bar on top, so it should inherit most of the responsiveness. Also, it uses Font Awesome for all glyphs and that means everything’s vector and smooth even at absurd pixel&nbsp;densities.</p>
<h2 id="offline">Offline</h2>
<p>Protobowl was designed first with a flexible sync architecture. However, regrettably, it wasn’t designed with the idea of Offline-first. Don’t get me wrong, offline works great, but it’s implemented with a offline.coffee which is largely (I’d say 80%) a reimplementation of methods in web.coffee. That’s not a good quantity of don’t repeat yourself, or at least it’s hardly&nbsp;ideal.</p>
<p>However, by virtue of running off Node, there’s a single language (javascript) which runs both client and server. As such there’s a natural ability to reuse some code, in this case, all the supporting libraries are shared between client and server, the answer checking (which is surprisingly sophisticated, albeit likely unnecessarily&nbsp;so). </p>
<p>Offline was built with Appcache in mind, that’s pretty obvious because you sort of need appcache to make things work offline. The offline code is loaded asynchronously and there isn’t any fundamental difference between offline-start and disconnect behavior. So that means there isn’t any fumbling between multiple copies of the code or any limitation on the functionality of the offline mode. You can disconnect from the server in the midst of the game, perhaps because of a flaky connection and you can continue without interruption. And it even tries to automatically reconnect, and picks up the state and resumes (albeit, probably losing what you’ve done&nbsp;offline).</p>
<p>I have a sort of wordsy packrat syndrome, so I’ll leave all the text above untarnished, and state plainly that none of the words above are true, not anymore at least. Version 3 was a rewrite of the entire core of protobowl: client, server, heaven and earth. And to make the architecture more clean and gody, I endeavored to share code between client and server in a pretty cool&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>I don’t think this is meant to be a technical exposé of the artistic symmetries in the yet-unmade <span class="caps">UML</span> diagram of the universe, but I’ll talk about it a bit anyway, at least long enough for this document to hit the 3000 word&nbsp;mark. </p>
<h2 id="interface">Interface</h2>
<p>This is what I really think matters, how to actually use it, and the little interaction&nbsp;features.</p>
<h3 id="keyboard">Keyboard</h3>
<p>The primary interface is meant to be the keyboard. In fact, early design sketches didn’t even include a button bar for the desktop <span class="caps">UI</span>. Eventually, I relented, and there’s now buttons, but still, use&nbsp;keyboards.</p>
<p>The first button is <code>space</code>, which make sense because it’s the biggest button and also probably the most important. Space generally means “buzz”, however there’s another very small thing it does: when you open up and see that big green button saying “start the game”, you can also press space to trigger that (no ambiguity since the buzz button is disabled in such&nbsp;circumstances).</p>
<p>Next, or skipping, as it was referred to in earlier iterations, is also a fairly commonplace operation. It can be accessed with not one, but three keys, <code>S</code>, <code>N</code> and <code>J</code>. <code>S</code> and <code>N</code> are probably pretty obvious, referring to “Skip” and “Next”. J is just convenient because it’s on the home row (well, so is <code>S</code>, technically) and usually refers to “down” for people who use Vi or Vim, although it is commonplace for websites to respect <code>j</code> meaning up, and <code>k</code> meaning down. (See: Facebook, all Google products,&nbsp;etc.)</p>
<p>You can pause and resume with <code>P</code> and <code>R</code>. Both are equivalent, so you can technically pause with <code>R</code>, and resume with <code>P</code>, though that would be metaphorically&nbsp;confusing. </p>
<p>Since it’s designed to be “social”, if you don’t mind me tossing around more loaded buzzwords, chat was one of the first features added (also one of the easiest, but that doesn’t help me rewrite history). Chat is accessed through the <code>/</code> key, that is, the forward slash or by pressing enter while not buzzed. For those who don’t like letters which aren’t in the alphabet, it’s also accessible through the letter <code>C</code>.</p>
<h3 id="buttons">Buttons</h3>
<p>Yeah, buttons, they exist. But they’re only meant to be used on mobile. Seriously, use your&nbsp;keyboard.</p>
<h3 id="other-things-you-can-click-on">Other things you can click&nbsp;on</h3>
<p>There are a number of non-button things which can be clicked on as&nbsp;well.</p>
<h4 id="breadcrumbs">Breadcrumbs</h4>
<p>The “breadcrumb”, as Bootstrap calls it, is the little row which precedes every question which includes the category, difficulty and tournament to which the question belongs. The one on the top isn’t clickable, but all the other ones are. Clicking on those expands the question readout which gets collapsed below&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Within the breadcrumb is a slightly grayed out word “Report”, which can be clicked on to bring up a (currently non-functional) modal dialog to submit a question for manual review in case there was something wrong with the question. For instance, maybe the question was formatted wrong or truncated, or you’re exceedingly pedantic and think that there is a typo which hinders your ability to participate, or&nbsp;something.</p>
<p>Also, on the far right is a blue star which can be clicked on to “bookmark” a question. Right now, bookmarking does little other than filling in that blue star and preventing the question from getting deleted (questions that drop far enough down get deleted unless they’re bookmarked). However, in the future, it may be imaginable that the bookmarked questions would be added to some kind of interface which could be managed by the&nbsp;server.</p>
<p>The breadcrumb also reveals the answer to the question whenever the question is&nbsp;over.</p>
<h4 id="leaderboard-statistics">Leaderboard/Statistics</h4>
<p>In multiplayer mode, there is a leaderboard showing a ranking of all the users who have participated in the room. In single player, it’s just a single grid giving your&nbsp;statistics.</p>
<h5 id="multiplayer">Multiplayer</h5>
<p>It’s a grid, which is pretty cool, the first row is the ranking and the score, the latter of which is inside a bubble which is colored. The score is at the moment computed based on the number of “early” answers, which are correct answers before the asterisk in applicable packets, the number of interrupts and the number of correct answers. The current weights are 15 for an early answer, 10 for a correct answer and -5 for an interrupt. The colors of the bubble denote the online status of the&nbsp;player:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>gray</code> the user is offline and has no connected sessions at that&nbsp;moment</li>
<li><code>orange</code> the user has not interacted with the game in the past 10 minutes, but has at least one session&nbsp;open</li>
<li><code>green</code> the user is online and has interacted with the room in the past 10&nbsp;minutes</li>
<li><code>blue</code> this row corresponds to&nbsp;you</li>
</ul>
<p>On the adjacent column is the user’s name and there is another column for the number of interrupts. There aren’t any more because there isn’t much&nbsp;space.</p>
<p>Clicking on any of the rows brings up a popover which gives a more complete breakdown of the user and his or her performance. That dialog can be dismissed by clicking (or tapping, for touch devices) again on the same&nbsp;row.</p>
<h5 id="single-player-offline">Single&nbsp;Player/Offline</h5>
<p>The single player mode has aesthetic similarities to the detailed popover of the multiplayer mode and this is hardly a coincidence. The default view for single player mode is just an abridged version of the popover’s view including only the score, the number correct, the number of interrupts and the total number of guesses. Clicking on the single player interface anywhere will reveal the more detailed interface (with purty sliding effects courtesy of&nbsp;jQuery).</p>
<p>On the single player header the “offline” badge lights up, well, quite obviously, when the user is&nbsp;offline.</p>
<p>It also has shiny transitions between single player and multiplayer&nbsp;modes.</p>
<h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>
<p>The debugging panel is the furthest down and takes the form of what looks like a table. The first two rows sound vaguely technical (with an underscore too!), latency and sync_offset. And you’d be right, they’re both just little metrics which go indicate the health of the network&nbsp;connection. </p>
<p>The titling of “Debugging” is a tad disingenuous, it’s mostly networking. But then again, networking is like the vast majority of what can actually&nbsp;fail. </p>
<p>The very last in the menu is a link that quite plainly says “Disconnect”, and opposite is a piece of text representing the application cache’s status. Disconnect is nice for when the network’s flakey and you know your connection won’t last long anyway. Or if you’re like antisocial and need to make your own little corner to cry in. Or something like that. Sure. Okay.&nbsp;Next.</p>
<h3 id="the-main-interface">The Main&nbsp;Interface</h3>
<p>I think I’m going to start over with this&nbsp;manual.</p>
<h1 id="blog-post">Blog&nbsp;Post</h1>
<p>For the past few weeks, I’ve been working on a project which was tentatively titled “Protobowl”, short for “Prototype Quizbowl Application”. And that probably suffices as some sort of cursory description of what it is, it’s an app which tries to mimic the experience of a quiz bowl competition online. Most importantly, it was designed for multiplayer from day&nbsp;one.</p>
<h2 id="backstory">Backstory</h2>
<p>The github page for this project was created two weeks ago at time of writing, but the history of the project actually extends much further back. For the past two years, I’ve been a member of my school’s quiz bowl team, not a particularly illustrious team, but like any non-dysfunctional organization, we do have a sense of enthusiasm for the game. I’ve wanted to do something which had something to do with it for a while, but never found a sufficient impetus to do it until late in&nbsp;May.</p>
<p>On May 25th of this year, I was introduced to the website quizbowldb.com which has a pretty cool question reader. My friend, who belongs to a team which is significantly better (as an understatement) was using that tool to prepare for a tournament. I spent a few minutes looking at the site and felt mildly disappointed that multiplayer didn’t work, but at least I found some niche that was worth catering&nbsp;to.</p>
<h3 id="bayesian-classifier">Bayesian&nbsp;Classifier</h3>
<p>The first thing which needed to be done was getting some set of labeled questions for the database. I looked around and found a few sources but most of them weren’t really large or labeled. I had finished the online <span class="caps">AI</span> class a few months ago, and felt like applying it in a fairly obvious scenario, so over the course of the next few hours I built a simple naive bayesian classifier to give categories to&nbsp;questions. </p>
<p>But, in order to do that, I had to first have some manually labeled corpus. I certainly wasn’t up for the tedium, so I decided to pull some from the quizbowldb.com site to seed the algorithm. At that point in time, for some reason, I was using some preview release of Windows 8 and rather regrettably couldn’t use wget. But I coped by writing a short python script (rather than the more reasonable solution of rebooting into another operating system) which would incrementally clone the site’s&nbsp;database. </p>
<p>Because of rate limiting or something to that effect, the script only pulled about 10 questions every 40 seconds, and given that there were 30,000 questions in the database, the process wasn’t terribly fast. I eventually booted back into linux and rewrote the script so that it was resumable (for the event that the script might be interrupted for some reason on its scheduled week-long&nbsp;run). </p>
<p>However, by the next day, some number of them were downloaded and that small number was enough to train the classifier. The first thing was trying to run the classifier on the question set itself and comparing how well it fared. The results were actually surprisingly good, and after careful combing through the exceptions, it appeared that most of the errors manifested from the manual mislabeling of the original&nbsp;corpus. </p>
<p>After that initial successful result, I did a bit of work on a question extraction algorithm which would use the command line version of Abiword to convert .doc and .docx files that packets are usually distributed as into some machine readable format for feeding into the classifier. However, I never quite finished that, as school work caught up with me and I waited for the database to finish&nbsp;downloading.</p>

<p>On June 7th, about two weeks after I built the first promising prototype of the question parser, I had noticed that the background task had finished. Actually, it finished something like a week earlier, but I hadn’t noticed. Lurking around through Wikipedia, I discovered that Roger Craig, the famed Jeopardy! contestant who wrote a program to help study had actually attended my high&nbsp;school.</p>
<p>But nothing really happened after that. The school year was nearing a close and the after school clubs were having their last meetings of the year. There was the standardized testing and the anxiety about the imminent end of the year, and I had other projects which seemed more enticing at the time. Narrower in scope and more doable in shorter periods of time. This app was always on the radar, it just gradually slipped further and further&nbsp;back.</p>
<h3 id="it-s-ac-attack">It’s Ac&nbsp;Attack</h3>
<p>I wasn’t the only person in my school’s quiz bowl team who was interested in pursuing the idea. In fact, it was Ben who actually started the app first. I didn’t write code for the actual project until two weeks&nbsp;ago.</p>
<p>Early in July (or possibly late in June), Ben wanted to build that quiz bowl application when I was still working on a few other projects as well as an internship. I gave him the big <span class="caps">JSON</span> file of questions and he toiled away for the next few days, experimenting first with Ruby on Rails and then later settling with Node.JS (and the accompanying popular&nbsp;stacks). </p>
<p>Within a few days, he had put out a pretty impressive application using Mongoose, Jade, Twitter Bootstrap, Express, and Node running on Heroku at the (now defunct) its-ac-attack <span class="caps">URL</span>. Soon afterwards search was fairly functional and I started to take an interest in the project again (having almost finished another project, though at time of writing, I have yet to begin writing the blog post for that&nbsp;project).</p>
<p>I felt like exploiting this opportunity to get acquainted somewhat with popular NodeJS frameworks and tools. I haven’t done much with Node for over two years, and the landscape has changed considerably in the intervening years. It’s a fast growing and developing community. However, I never really found interest in building the entire app. Managing users and doing search has always struck me as somewhat boring, in part because it’s hardly untreaded&nbsp;territory.</p>
<p>I wanted to skip straight into the low latency websocket-driven synchronized multiplayer. Ben was still acclimating to the multimodal (if I’m using these buzzwords right) paradigm of writing code meant to be executed on both the client and the server, so I decided to prototype a multiplayer&nbsp;environment.</p>

<p>Chronologically, this places us at about two weeks ago. That’s actually quite confusing because I wrote that sentence a bit over a month ago, where “a month ago” means August 8th, and “now” means September 12th. That is, you can imagine the gap between the first sentence in this paragraph and the sentence immediately succeeding it as joined by that scene from Monty Python where the animator dies of some fatal heart attack, in which case that animator is me, and I just sort of gave up on writing the&nbsp;readme. </p>
<p>And just like that, in the blink of a sentence, it’s been another&nbsp;month. </p>

<p><em>Oh Lord, I’m so sorry</em>.</p>
<p>I once heard a story about a magnificent exhibit at the 1964 World’s Fair— there was a great monument to the synergy of mind, hand, and electromechanical accomplishment— a fully functional 40 foot steel&nbsp;typewriter. </p>
<p>Children and adults alike would carefully crawl up the giant black injection-molded keys until they reached their favorite letter, at which point they started jumping furiously to activate the spring-loaded&nbsp;key. </p>
<p>When it finally gave way, they’d sit down and marvel at the thunderous spirit they had awakened. There was a magnificent whiffle tree mechanism which spun a solid metal typeball with such heft that you couldn’t help but imagine whether the Earth itself was the type element of God’s cosmic typewriter— his tool for imprinting the ribbon of time with the ink of&nbsp;fate.</p>
<p>They called it an I-beam&nbsp;Selectric.</p>
<hr>
<p>Sometimes you hear a story which involves the confluence of so many strange coincidences, you’re almost certain that it’s all build-up for some colossal letdown of a&nbsp;punchline. </p>
<p>That’s what the title— “Microsoft Outlook Offline Address Book (<span class="caps">OAB</span>) Format Parser in Python” should probably evoke— and if that wasn’t enough, the photo of a BOA Constrictor on the thumbnail should certainly put it over the&nbsp;edge. </p>
<p>I don’t expect anyone in the world to find a legitimate use of something like this, but I feel obligated to write a blog post anyway. So I’ll write it about the vague subject of bad puns— because I happened to name an <span class="caps">OAB</span> parser written in a certain snake-related language an anagram of the format which shares a name with a particular snake-related&nbsp;snake.  </p>
<!-- 
The timestamp on this post, like probably half of them in 2014 is a lie. I'm actually writing this June 9, 2015— but I have an excuse, well, an excuse which is a bit different from that other excuse that I'm probably employing for literally every other post. 

Up until this year, literally anyone connected to the internet could go to mit.edu and find out the dorm and room number of any student at MIT. In practice it probably doesn't mean much, but it's a violation of certain expectations of privacy. It's been closed now.

That said, I think it would be pretty interesting to visualize the flux of housing migrations, both within dorms and in between them.

I had done it at a somewhat smaller scale after the freshman housing lottery at my dorm, as they had sent out an email to every resident about the new assignments— I just plugged them into Graphviz and got a cool graph. One fun game is searching for the longest cycle (essentially a group of people who happen to have rotated their room ownership). 

But I didn't really want to write a bot which would scrape the web service, and it turns out I didn't have to. MIT uses Outlook Web Access for emails, and there's a feature in Outlook to download the address book offline. That address book happens to include the address information, and it gets stored in the Microsoft Offline Address Book format. 

Why is this part of the post in a comment? I'm not totally sure.

<p>Well, so my blog got hacked. Even more unfortunate is that I can’t seem to locate any trace of what it looked like when it was hacked. I guess that’s the problem when you write a post-mortem literally a year after the original&nbsp;incident. </p>
<p>All that’s left is some eerie hints that something&nbsp;happened.</p>
<p>My blog was averaging around <span class="caps">350MB</span> of bandwidth per day, when suddenly on June 6th, it started to spike. In fact, between June 6th and 7th, it used a total of over 40GB of bandwidth. It had eaten through my entire monthly bandwidth&nbsp;quota. </p>
<p><div class="pic md" style="" ><img alt=""  src="/articles/2014/Getting%20Hacked/table.png" ></div></p>
<p>At 6:48pm on June 7th, I had discovered that something was going on with my blog and started the process of fixing it. I looked through some of the access logs and saw a particular abundance of a strange file <code>pffam.php</code></p>
<pre><code><span style='display:none' detected-language='groovy'></span><span class="hljs-number">91.234</span><span class="hljs-number">.164</span><span class="hljs-number">.143</span> - - [<span class="hljs-number">07</span><span class="hljs-regexp">/Jun/</span><span class="hljs-number">2014</span>:<span class="hljs-number">05</span>:<span class="hljs-number">07</span>:<span class="hljs-number">18</span> -<span class="hljs-number">0400</span>] <span class="hljs-string">"<span class="caps">POST</span> /wp/wp-content/themes/carrington-woot/pffam.php HTTP/1.1"</span> <span class="hljs-number">500</span> <span class="hljs-number">7309</span> <span class="hljs-string">"-"</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Mozilla/3.0 (compatible; Indy Library)"</span>

</code></pre><p>Presumably <code>pffam.php</code> was the bit of malicious code which was injected onto my server, acting as a nice endpoint for recieving and executing particular actions. It seems that <a href="http://www.indyproject.org/index.en.aspx">Indy Library</a> is some sort of .<span class="caps">NET</span> library which implements&nbsp;HTTP. </p>
<p>It’s interesting that the endpoint is being hit by multiple <span class="caps">IP</span> addresses, and they all seem to geolocate to Eastern European countries. Presumably they’ve built some sort of graphical Command <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Control panel out of Visual Basic or&nbsp;something. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, it looks like I replaced the entire wordpress installation with an older backup— so I don’t actually have any copies of <code>pffam.php</code>. But it managed to use <span class="caps">40GB</span> of bandwidth, and hackers are hardly keen on keeping all their eggs in one bucket, so surely there must have been other endpoints—&nbsp;right?</p>
<p>Sure enough, there’s another&nbsp;endpoint:</p>
<pre><code><span style='display:none' detected-language='groovy'></span><span class="hljs-number">109.87</span><span class="hljs-number">.224</span><span class="hljs-number">.22</span> - - [<span class="hljs-number">06</span><span class="hljs-regexp">/Jun/</span><span class="hljs-number">2014</span>:<span class="hljs-number">21</span>:<span class="hljs-number">18</span>:<span class="hljs-number">06</span> -<span class="hljs-number">0400</span>] <span class="hljs-string">"<span class="caps">POST</span> /ajaxanimator/stick2-old/jsgif/Demos/dswbk.php HTTP/1.1"</span> <span class="hljs-number">200</span> <span class="hljs-number">4</span> <span class="hljs-string">"-"</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Mozilla/3.0 (compatible; Indy Library)"</span>

</code></pre><p>I’m guessing that it’s being used to send spam messages to different people using the <span class="caps">PHP</span> <code>mail()</code> function. </p>
<hr>
<p>More interesting is <code>fr1.php</code>, which is obfuscated as a giant base 64 encoded gzipped&nbsp;string. </p>
<pre><code><span style='display:none' detected-language='bash'></span><span class="hljs-built_in">eval</span>(gzinflate(base64_decode(<span class="hljs-string">'HZzHkoTKkkQ/591r...h/Pp/jc/L/+59///33f/4f'</span>)));
</code></pre><p>So to see what went inside, I stuck it in a different file and replaced the <code>eval</code> with <code>echo</code>. The first time I ran it, I had a bit of a double take because the result looked like&nbsp;this:</p>
<pre><code><span style='display:none' detected-language='bash'></span><span class="hljs-built_in">eval</span>(gzinflate(base64_decode(<span class="hljs-string">'FZ23kuNKtkU/Z+<span class="caps">4NGN</span>...gRP6r//+ffff//v/wE='</span>)));
</code></pre><p>And if two times isn’t sufficiently meta, this happens a&nbsp;third</p>
<pre><code><span style='display:none' detected-language='bash'></span><span class="hljs-built_in">eval</span>(gzinflate(base64_decode(<span class="hljs-string">'FZy3buRaFkU/Z94DA3q...GAfkEQPM8TBK/yP//+++9//w8='</span>)));

</code></pre><p>Actually, it goes on <strong>40 more times</strong>, like a demented matroyshka doll. It’s not <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8 encoded, so I had to guess a handful of encodings before discovering that it was what Sublime Text calls “Cyrillic (Windows 1251)”. It’s 1500 lines, so I’ve posted it in a <a href="https://gist.github.com/antimatter15/f40a4615c68eea373ad4">Gist</a> rather than sticking it inline&nbsp;here. </p>
<p>I skimmed through the code and it seemed relatively safe— or at least it didn’t seem to plant any rootkits or start any persistent processes. So I ran it and got a screenshot. It seems to call itself “C99madShell v. 3.0 <span class="caps">BLOG</span>&nbsp;edition.php”</p>

<hr>
<p>The other distinct file, <code>xstyles.php</code> seems to be a little more&nbsp;unique. </p>
<pre><code><span style='display:none' detected-language='tex'></span>&lt;?php

</code></pre><p>So what does it do? Well, the first part basically just assembles <code>q</code> with the value&nbsp;“assert”. </p>
<pre><code><span style='display:none' detected-language='cs'></span><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">bool</span> <span class="hljs-title">assert</span> <span class="hljs-params">( mixed $assertion [, <span class="hljs-keyword">string</span> $description ] )</span></span>
</code></pre><p>When <span class="caps">PHP</span>’s built-in assert function is passed a string <code>$assertion</code>, it evaluates that string. It’s less known than <code>eval</code> so this is plausibly useful for evading firewalls of a certain sort. So what it finally translates to&nbsp;is:</p>
<pre><code><span style='display:none' detected-language='bash'></span>assert(<span class="hljs-string">"eval('eval(gzinflate(base64_decode(<span class="hljs-variable">$v</span>)));');"</span>)
</code></pre><p>The decoded file starts out like&nbsp;this:</p>
<pre><code><span style='display:none' detected-language='handlebars'></span><span class="xml"><span class="php"><span class="hljs-preprocessor">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="hljs-variable">$auth_pass</span> = <span class="hljs-string">"cef26cef9c9fdbdb49363368c8921635"</span>;
<span class="hljs-variable">$color</span> = <span class="hljs-string">"#df5"</span>;
<span class="hljs-variable">$default_action</span> = <span class="hljs-string">'FilesMan'</span>;
<span class="hljs-variable">$default_use_ajax</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">true</span>;
<span class="hljs-variable">$default_charset</span> = <span class="hljs-string">'Windows-1251'</span>;</span></span>
</code></pre><p>I searched around for the password, but nobody’s yet been able to find a matching plaintext. However, along the way I found out about <a href="http://ddecode.com/phpdecoder/">PHPDecoder</a> which would have saved quite a bit of time an hour&nbsp;ago.</p>
<p>This one is also 1500 lines, so I’ve posted it in another <a href="https://gist.github.com/antimatter15/a2375e36f0f04dc6b3fb">Gist</a>. This one looks aesthetically a bit nicer— if it’s not too weird to complement the tools of the people who hacked your&nbsp;website. </p>
<p><div class="pic md" style="" ><img alt="WebShell"  src="/articles/2014/Getting%20Hacked/xstyles.png" ></div></p>
<hr>
<p>There’s one (hah, pun not intended) folder entitled <code>1/</code> which is particularly interesting. It has three subdirectories: <code>configweb</code>, <code>sym</code>, and <code>tumdizin</code>.</p>
<p>Configweb seems to be a directory filled with symlinks to 9414 distinct configuration files, each of them residing on someone else’s home directory. It encompasses lots of different software packages including Joomla, Wordpress, Zencart, <span class="caps">SMF</span>, WHM, OSCommerce, VBulletin and&nbsp;ore. </p>
<p>The directory <code>sym</code> seems to just contain a symlink entitled <code>root</code> to— you guessed it— <code>/</code>. </p>
<p>And finally <code>tumdizin</code> seems to link to the web roots of 116 distinct shared hosting accounts which happen to reside on the same&nbsp;server.</p>
<hr>
<p>There’s also that folders which blow up in the tree <code>x4MslaR1CW</code>, and <code>ptRiJiayze</code>. You can probably guess by files like <code>logo_paypal_106x29.png</code> that this site got turned essentially into a phishing website for Paypal. I’m actually rather amazed that the result looks so&nbsp;plausible. </p>

<p>However, it seems that there was some weird activity going on starting a few days before the massive traffic. There’s an <code>error_log</code> file which seems to grow pretty slowly in general. There was a fairly large stretch from January to June with no errors— and then it seemed to constantly encounter these errors leading up to the traffic&nbsp;spike. </p>

<p>I ended up downloading a daily backup of the server which was taken before it was hacked (June 1, 2014) and installing it onto a small virtual machine. I downloaded a Wordpress plugin for exporting the entire website as static <span class="caps">HTML</span> pages and uploaded it to Github pages. This served as a stop-gap measure for almost an entire year while I was getting the new site to&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>This experience is largely why I decided that this new incarnation would be a static site— essentially free from the perils that come with a dynamic website. It’s not like the old version used dynamic content to much advantage anyway, it was cached enough that it was practically static&nbsp;anyway. </p>
